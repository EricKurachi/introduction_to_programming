CHAPTER 1
Jonathan Harker's Journal 3 May. Bistritz.--Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late.  Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets.  I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule. We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale.  I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty.  (Mem. get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here, indeed, I don't know how I should be able to get on without it. Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country.
I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordance Survey Maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place.  I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.
In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:  Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North.  I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns.  This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting.  (Mem., I must ask the Count all about them.) I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had all sorts of queer dreams.  There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was still thirsty.  Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was "mamaliga", and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call "impletata". (Mem., get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains.  What ought they to be in China? All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind.  Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods.  It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire.  Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets, and round hats, and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist.  They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails.  They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and
heavy black moustaches.  They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing.  On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands.  They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion. It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very interesting old place.  Being practically on the frontier--for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it.  Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions.  At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease. Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white undergarment with a long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty.  When I came close she bowed and said, "The Herr Englishman?" "Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with a letter: "My friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians.  I am anxiously expecting you.  Sleep well tonight.  At three tomorrow the diligence will start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you.  At the Borgo Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me.  I trust that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.--Your friend, Dracula."
4 May--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count, directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way.  He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he knew.  When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further.  It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask anyone else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting. Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a hysterical way:  "Must you go?  Oh!  Young Herr, must you go?"  She
was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all.  I was just able to follow her by asking many questions.  When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business, she asked again: "Do you know what day it is?"  I answered that it was the fourth of May.  She shook her head as she said again: "Oh, yes!  I know that!  I know that, but do you know what day it is?" On my saying that I did not understand, she went on: "It is the eve of St. George's Day.  Do you not know that tonight, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway?  Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?"  She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect.  Finally, she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable.  However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my goodbye.  Here comes the coach!
5 May.  The Castle.--The gray of the morning has passed, and the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, naturally I write till sleep comes.
There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they called "robber steak"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks, and roasted over the fire, in simple style of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else. When I got on the coach, the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking to the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly.  I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd, so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were "Ordog"--Satan, "Pokol"--hell, "stregoica"--witch, "vrolok" and "vlkoslak"--both mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either werewolf or vampire.  (Mem., I must ask the Count about these superstitions.) When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty, I got a fellow passenger to tell me what they meant.  He would not answer at first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man.  But everyone seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the boxseat,--"gotza" they call them--cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey. I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have been able to throw them off so easily.  Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank
gable end to the road.  There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry.  And as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the "Mittel Land" ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame.  The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund.  I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows.  In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order.  Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point. Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves.  Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly.  Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water.  One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us. "Look!  Isten szek!"--"God's seat!"--and he crossed himself reverently. As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us.  This was emphasized by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink.  Here and there we passed Cszeks and slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent.  By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves.  Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world.  There were many things new to me.  For instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasants's cart--with its long, snakelike vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road.  On this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end.  As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills,
as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow.  Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys.  Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could only go slowly.  I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it.  "No, no," he said.  "You must not walk here. The dogs are too fierce."  And then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest--"And you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep."  The only stop he would make was a moment's pause to light his lamps. When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging him to further speed.  He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions.  Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills.  The excitement of the passengers grew greater.  The crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea.  I had to hold on.  The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along.  Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us.  We were entering on the Borgo Pass.  One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial.  These were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that same strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.  Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness.  It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time.  And at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side.  There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder.  It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one.  I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count.  Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness, but all was dark.  The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud.  We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment.  I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone, I thought it was "An hour less than the time."  Then turning to me, he spoke in German worse than my own.
"There is no carriage here.  The Herr is not expected after all.  He will now come on to Bukovina, and return tomorrow or the next day, better the next day."  Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up.  Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a caleche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach.  I could see from the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals.  They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us.  I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver, "You are early tonight, my friend." The man stammered in reply, "The English Herr was in a hurry." To which the stranger replied, "That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina.  You cannot deceive me, my friend.  I know too much, and my horses are swift." As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory.  One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger's "Lenore". "Denn die Todten reiten Schnell."  ("For the dead travel fast.") The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile.  The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself.  "Give me the Herr's luggage," said the driver, and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the caleche.  Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the caleche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel.  His strength must have been prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the pass.  As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina.  As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling come over me.  But a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German--"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all care of you.  There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it." I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same.  I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened.  I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey.  The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road.  It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again, and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so.  I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I
thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch.  It was within a few minutes of midnight.  This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences.  I waited with a sick feeling of suspense. Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road, a long, agonized wailing, as if from fear.  The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright.  Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling, that of wolves, which affected both the horses and myself in the same way.  For I was minded to jump from the caleche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled.  The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace.  This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right. Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel.  And again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side.  Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.  It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket.  The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way.  The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side.  I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear.  The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed. He kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness. Suddenly, away on our left I saw a faint flickering blue flame.  The driver saw it at the same moment.  He at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness.  I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer.  But while I wondered, the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey.  I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be
repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.  Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver's motions.  He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose, it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all, and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect.  When he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same.  This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness.  Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle. At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright.  I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether. But just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair.  They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.  For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear.  It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import. All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them.  The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see.  But the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side, and they had perforce to remain within it.  I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach, I shouted and beat the side of the caleche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from the side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap.  How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still.  Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness. When I could see again the driver was climbing into the caleche, and the wolves disappeared.  This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move.  The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending.  Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the sky.
CHAPTER 2
Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued 5 May.--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place.  In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is.  I have not yet been able to see it by daylight. When the caleche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight.  Again I could not but notice his prodigious strength.  His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen.  Then he took my traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone.  I could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather.  As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins.  The horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings. I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do.  Of bell or knocker there was no sign.  Through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me.  What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?  What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's clerk!  Mina would not like that.  Solicitor, for just before leaving London I got word that my examination was successful, and I am now a full-blown solicitor!  I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake.  It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork.  But my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived.  I was indeed awake and among the Carpathians.  All I could do now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of morning. Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light.  Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back.  A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back. Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour about him anywhere.  He held in his hand an antique silver lamp, in which the flame burned without a chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door.  The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange
intonation. "Welcome to my house!  Enter freely and of your own free will!"  He made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone.  The instant, however, that I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed cold as ice, more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said, "Welcome to my house!  Enter freely.  Go safely, and leave something of the happiness you bring!"  The strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was speaking.  So to make sure, I said interrogatively, "Count Dracula?" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied, "I am Dracula, and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.  Come in, the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest."  As he was speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out, took my luggage.  He had carried it in before I could forestall him.  I protested, but he insisted. "Nay, sir, you are my guest.  It is late, and my people are not available.  Let me see to your comfort myself."  He insisted on carrying my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily.  At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, flamed and flared. The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter.  It was a welcome sight.  For here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire, also added to but lately, for the top logs were fresh, which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney.  The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the door. "You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your toilet.  I trust you will find all you wish.  When you are ready, come into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared." The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears.  Having then reached my normal state, I discovered that I was half famished with hunger.  So making a hasty toilet, I went into the other room. I found supper already laid out.  My host, who stood on one side of the great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of his hand to the table, and said, "I pray you, be seated and sup how you please.  You will I trust,
excuse me that I do not join you, but I have dined already, and I do not sup." I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.  He opened it and read it gravely.  Then, with a charming smile, he handed it to me to read.  One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of pleasure. "I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come.  But I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in whom I have every possible confidence.  He is a young man, full of energy and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition.  He is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service.  He shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take your instructions in all matters." The count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken.  This, with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old tokay, of which I had two glasses, was my supper.  During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had experienced. By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy. His face was a strong, a very strong, aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils, with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere.  His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth. These protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years.  For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed.  The chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin.  The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor. Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine.  But seeing them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather coarse, broad, with squat fingers.  Strange to say, there were hairs in the centre of the palm.  The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point.  As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not repress a shudder.  It may have been that his breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back.  And with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his protruberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace.  We were both silent for a while, and as I looked towards the window I saw the first
dim streak of the coming dawn.  There seemed a strange stillness over everything.  But as I listened, I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves.  The Count's eyes gleamed, and he said. "Listen to them, the children of the night.  What music they make!" Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he added, "Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter."  Then he rose and said. "But you must be tired.  Your bedroom is all ready, and tomorrow you shall sleep as late as you will.  I have to be away till the afternoon, so sleep well and dream well!"  With a courteous bow, he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom. I am all in a sea of wonders.  I doubt.  I fear.  I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul.  God keep me, if only for the sake of those dear to me!
7 May.--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the last twenty-four hours.  I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my own accord.  When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth.  There was a card on the table, on which was written--"I have to be absent for a while.  Do not wait for me.  D."  I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal.  When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I might let the servants know I had finished, but I could not find one.  There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me.  The table service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.  The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old, though in excellent order.  I saw something like them in Hampton Court, but they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten.  But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror.  There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair.  I have not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.  Some time after I had finished my meal, I do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had it, I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about the castle until I had asked the Count's permission.  There was absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing materials, so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of library.  The door opposite mine I tried, but found locked. In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers.  A table in the centre was littered with English magazines and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date.  The books were of the most varied kind, history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology, law, all relating to England and English life and customs and manners.  There were even such books of
reference as the London Directory, the "Red" and "Blue" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and it somehow gladdened my heart to see it, the Law List. Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count entered.  He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good night's rest.  Then he went on. "I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that will interest you.  These companions," and he laid his hand on some of the books, "have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours of pleasure.  Through them I have come to know your great England, and to know her is to love her.  I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes it what it is.  But alas!  As yet I only know your tongue through books.  To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak." "But, Count," I said, "You know and speak English thoroughly!"  He bowed gravely. "I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel.  True, I know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them." "Indeed," I said, "You speak excellently." "Not so," he answered.  "Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger.  That is not enough for me.  Here I am noble.  I am a Boyar.  The common people know me, and I am master.  But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one.  Men know him not, and to know not is to care not for.  I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he sees me, or pauses in his speaking if he hears my words, 'Ha, ha!  A stranger!' I have been so long master that I would be master still, or at least that none other should be master of me.  You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London.  You shall, I trust, rest here with me a while, so that by our talking I may learn the English intonation.  And I would that you tell me when I make error, even of the smallest, in my speaking.  I am sorry that I had to be away so long today, but you will, I know forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand." Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might come into that room when I chose.  He answered, "Yes, certainly," and added. "You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course you will not wish to go.  There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand."  I said I was sure of this, and then he went on. "We are in Transylvania, and Transylvania is not England.  Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things.  Nay, from what you have told me of your experiences already, you know
something of what strange things there may be." This led to much conversation, and as it was evident that he wanted to talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice. Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand, but generally he answered all I asked most frankly.  Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as for instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames.  He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year, last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway, a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed. "That treasure has been hidden," he went on, "in the region through which you came last night, there can be but little doubt.  For it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk.  Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders.  In the old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them, men and women, the aged and the children too, and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches.  When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil." "But how," said I, "can it have remained so long undiscovered, when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?" The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely.  He answered: "Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool!  Those flames only appear on one night, and on that night no man of this land will, if he can help it, stir without his doors.  And, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what to do.  Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work.  Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to find these places again?" "There you are right," I said.  "I know no more than the dead where even to look for them."  Then we drifted into other matters. "Come," he said at last, "tell me of London and of the house which you have procured for me."  With an apology for my remissness, I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag.  Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark.  The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide.  When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table, and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts.  He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings.  He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much more than I did.  When I remarked this, he
answered. "Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should?  When I go there I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan, nay, pardon me.  I fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first, my friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me.  He will be in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins.  So!" We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at Purfleet.  When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place.  I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I inscribe here. "At Purfleet, on a byroad, I came across just such a place as seemed to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale.  It was surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years.  The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust. "The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old Quatre Face, as the house is four sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass.  It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned.  There are many trees on it, which make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream.  The house is very large and of all periods back, I should say, to mediaeval times, for one part is of stone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron.  It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or church.  I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading to it from the house, but I have taken with my Kodak views of it from various points.  The house had been added to, but in a very straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must be very great.  There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum.  It is not, however, visible from the grounds." When I had finished, he said, "I am glad that it is old and big.  I myself am of an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a day, and after all, how few days go to make up a century.  I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times.  We Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead.  I seek not gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay.  I am no longer young, and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mirth.  Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken.  The shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements.  I love the shade and the shadow, and would be alone with my thoughts when I may."  Somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine.
Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to pull my papers together.  He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of the books around me.  One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally to England, as if that map had been much used.  On looking at it I found in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new estate was situated.  The other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast. It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned.  "Aha!" he said.  "Still at your books?  Good!  But you must not work always. Come!  I am informed that your supper is ready."  He took my arm, and we went into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table.  The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from home.  But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.  After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour after hour.  I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in every way.  I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me, but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.  They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to dawn or at the turn of the tide.  Anyone who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it.  All at once we heard the crow of the cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air. Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said, "Why there is the morning again!  How remiss I am to let you stay up so long.  You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by us," and with a courtly bow, he quickly left me. I went into my room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice.  My window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky.  So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day.
8 May.--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too diffuse.  But now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I cannot but feel uneasy.  I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had never come.  It may be that this strange night existence is telling on me, but would that that were all!  If there were any one to talk to I could bear it, but there is no one.  I have only the Count to speak with, and he--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place.  Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be.  It will help me to bear up, and imagination must not run riot with me.  If it does I am lost.  Let me say at once how I stand, or seem to. I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could not sleep any more, got up.  I had hung my shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave.  Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Count's voice saying to me, "Good morning."  I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the
reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me.  In starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice it at the moment.  Having answered the Count's salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.  This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder.  But there was no reflection of him in the mirror!  The whole room behind me was displayed, but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near.  But at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin.  I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster.  When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat.  I drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix.  It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there. "Take care," he said, "take care how you cut yourself.  It is more dangerous that you think in this country."  Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on, "And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief.  It is a foul bauble of man's vanity.  Away with it!"  And opening the window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below.  Then he withdrew without a word.  It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving pot, which is fortunately of metal. When I went into the dining room, breakfast was prepared, but I could not find the Count anywhere.  So I breakfasted alone.  It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink.  He must be a very peculiar man!  After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle.  I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it.  The castle is on the very edge of a terrific precipice.  A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything!  As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm.  Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests. But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I explored further.  Doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted.  In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit.  The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!
CHAPTER 3
Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued
When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.  I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every window I could find, but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings.  When I look back after a few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap.  When, however, the conviction had come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietly, as quietly as I have ever done anything in my life, and began to think over what was best to be done.  I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion.  Of one thing only am I certain.  That it is no use making my ideas known to the Count.  He knows well that I am imprisoned, and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts.  So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open.  I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits, and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through. I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut, and knew that the Count had returned.  He did not come at once into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed.  This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought, that there are no servants in the house.  When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining room, I was assured of it.  For if he does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here.  This is a terrible thought, for if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand for silence?  How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me?  What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck!  For it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it.  It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help.  Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort?  Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it.  In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand.  Tonight he may talk of himself, if I turn the conversation that way.  I must be very careful, however, not to awake his suspicion.
Midnight.--I have had a long talk with the Count.  I asked him a few questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully.  In his speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all.  This he afterwards explained by saying that to a Boyar the pride of his house and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their fate is his fate.  Whenever he spoke of his house he always said "we", and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking.  I wish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most fascinating.  It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country.
He grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength.  One thing he said which I shall put down as nearly as I can, for it tells in its way the story of his race. "We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, aye, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the werewolves themselves had come.  Here, too, when they came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert.  Fools, fools!  What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins?"  He held up his arms.  "Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race, that we were proud, that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier, that the Honfoglalas was completed there?  And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkeyland.  Aye, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for as the Turks say, 'water sleeps, and the enemy is sleepless.'  Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the 'bloody sword,' or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King?  When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent?  Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground?  This was a Dracula indeed!  Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them!  Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkeyland, who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They said that he thought only of himself.  Bah!  What good are peasants without a leader?  Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it?  Again, when, after the battle of Mohacs, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the Szekelys, and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains, and their swords, can boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach.  The warlike days are over.  Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace, and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told." It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed.  (Mem., this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the "Arabian Nights," for everything has to break off at cockcrow, or like the ghost of Hamlet's father.)
12 May.--Let me begin with facts, bare, meager facts, verified by books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt.  I must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation, or my memory of them.  Last evening when the Count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business.  I had spent the day wearily over books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the matters I had been examined in at Lincoln's Inn.  There was a certain method in the Count's inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in sequence.  The knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me. First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest.  He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor.  I asked to explain more fully, so that I might not by any chance mislead him, so he said, "I shall illustrate.  Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good!  Now here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only, and as one of London residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest.  Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?" I answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble. "But," said he, "I could be at liberty to direct myself.  Is it not so?" "Of course," I replied, and "Such is often done by men of business, who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person." "Good!" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded against.  I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability, and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not
think of or foresee.  For a man who was never in the country, and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were wonderful.  When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books available, he suddenly stood up and said, "Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any other?" It was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody. "Then write now, my young friend," he said, laying a heavy hand on my shoulder, "write to our friend and to any other, and say, if it will please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now." "Do you wish me to stay so long?" I asked, for my heart grew cold at the thought. "I desire it much, nay I will take no refusal.  When your master, employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted.  I have not stinted.  Is it not so?" What could I do but bow acceptance?  It was Mr. Hawkins' interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself, and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice.  The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless way. "I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters.  It will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting home to them.  Is it not so?"  As he spoke he handed me three sheets of note paper and three envelopes.  They were all of the thinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be more careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it.  So I determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could write shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he did see it.  When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to some books on his table.  Then he took up my two and placed them with his own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which were face down on the table.  I felt no compunction in doing so for under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way I could. One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna.  The third was to Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth, bankers, Buda Pesth.  The second and fourth were unsealed.  I was just about to look at them when I saw the door handle move.  I sank back in
my seat, having just had time to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his hand, entered the room.  He took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully, and then turning to me, said, "I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this evening.  You will, I hope, find all things as you wish."  At the door he turned, and after a moment's pause said, "Let me advise you, my dear young friend.  Nay, let me warn you with all seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle.  It is old, and has many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely.  Be warned!  Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be safe.  But if you be not careful in this respect, then," He finished his speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them.  I quite understood.  My only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me.
Later.--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no doubt in question.  I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not.  I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed, I imagine that my rest is thus freer from dreams, and there it shall remain. When he left me I went to my room.  After a little while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South.  There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard.  Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night.  I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.  It is destroying my nerve.  I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings.  God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place!  I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day.  In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness.  The mere beauty seemed to cheer me.  There was peace and comfort in every breath I drew.  As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out.  The window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete.  But it was evidently many a day since the case had been there.  I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out. What I saw was the Count's head coming out from the window.  I did not see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms.  In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had some many opportunities of studying.  I was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner.  But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over the dreadful abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out around him like
great wings.  At first I could not believe my eyes.  I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow, but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion.  I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall. What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature, is it in the semblance of man?  I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me.  I am in fear, in awful fear, and there is no escape for me.  I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of.
15 May.--Once more I have seen the count go out in his lizard fashion. He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left.  He vanished into some hole or window.  When his head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without avail.  The distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight.  I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet.  I went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors.  They were all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new. But I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally.  I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains.  But the door was locked, and the key was gone!  That key must be in the Count's room.  I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape.  I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them.  One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten.  At last, however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it seemed locked, gave a little under pressure.  I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor.  Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that I could enter.  I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down.  From the windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south.  On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice.  The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured.  To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone.  This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more an air of comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and moth.  My lamp seemed to be of little
effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble.  Still, it was better than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude come over me.  Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love letter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last.  It is the nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance.  And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere "modernity" cannot kill.
Later:  The morning of 16 May.--God preserve my sanity, for to this I am reduced.  Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.  Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already.  If I be sane, then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me, that to him alone I can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his purpose.  Great God!  Merciful God, let me be calm, for out of that way lies madness indeed.  I begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me.  Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant when he made Hamlet say, "My tablets!  Quick, my tablets!  'tis meet that I put it down," etc., For now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.  The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me. The Count's mysterious warning frightened me at the time.  It frightens me more not when I think of it, for in the future he has a fearful hold upon me.  I shall fear to doubt what he may say! When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy.  The Count's warning came into my mind, but I took pleasure in disobeying it.  The sense of sleep was upon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider.  The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me.  I determined not to return tonight to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars.  I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep.  I suppose I must have fallen asleep.  I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly real, so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep. I was not alone.  The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I came into it.  I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust.  In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner.  I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, they threw no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some time, and then
whispered together.  Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes, that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon.  The other was fair, as fair as can be, with great masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires.  I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where.  All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips.  There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear.  I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips.  It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain, but it is the truth.  They whispered together, and then they all three laughed, such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of waterglasses when played on by a cunning hand.  The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her on. One said, "Go on!  You are first, and we shall follow.  Yours is the right to begin." The other added, "He is young and strong.  There are kisses for us all." I lay quiet, looking out from under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.  The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath upon me.  Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood. I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes.  The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating.  There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth.  Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed to fasten on my throat.  Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and I could feel the hot breath on my neck.  Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer, nearer.  I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super sensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.  I closed my eyes in languorous ecstasy and waited, waited with beating heart. But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning.  I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury.  As my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion.  But the Count!  Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit.  His eyes were positively blazing.  The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames
of hell fire blazed behind them.  His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires.  The thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal.  With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating them back.  It was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves.  In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring in the room he said, "How dare you touch him, any of you?  How dare you cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it?  Back, I tell you all!  This man belongs to me!  Beware how you meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me." The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him. "You yourself never loved.  You never love!"  On this the other women joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear.  It seemed like the pleasure of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively, and said in a soft whisper, "Yes, I too can love.  You yourselves can tell it from the past.  Is it not so?  Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall kiss him at your will.  Now go!  Go!  I must awaken him, for there is work to be done." "Are we to have nothing tonight?" said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some living thing within it.  For answer he nodded his head.  One of the women jumped forward and opened it.  If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half smothered child.  The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with horror.  But as I looked, they disappeared, and with them the dreadful bag.  There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me without my noticing.  They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away. Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.
CHAPTER 4
Jonathan Harker's Journal Continued I awoke in my own bed.  If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must have carried me here.  I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but could not arrive at any unquestionable result.  To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit.  My watch was still unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and many such details.  But these things are no proof, for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, for some cause or another, I had certainly been much upset.  I must watch for proof.  Of one thing I am glad.  If it was that the Count carried
me here and undressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact.  I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked.  He would have taken or destroyed it.  As I look round this room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who were, who are, waiting to suck my blood.
18 May.--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for I must know the truth.  When I got to the doorway at the top of the stairs I found it closed.  It had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered.  I could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.  I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.
19 May.--I am surely in the toils.  Last night the Count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days, another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz.  I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I am so absolutely in his power.  And to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger.  He knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him.  My only chance is to prolong my opportunities.  Something may occur which will give me a chance to escape.  I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him.  He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends.  And he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion.  I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and then said, "The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June 29." I know now the span of my life.  God help me!
28 May.--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to send word home.  A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are encamped in the courtyard.  These are gipsies.  I have notes of them in my book.  They are peculiar to this part of the world, though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over.  There are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.  They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar, and call themselves by his name.  They are fearless and without religion, save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany tongue. I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them posted.  I have already spoken to them through my window to begin
acquaintanceship.  They took their hats off and made obeisance and many signs, which however, I could not understand any more than I could their spoken language . . . I have written the letters.  Mina's is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr. Hawkins to communicate with her.  To her I have explained my situation, but without the horrors which I may only surmise.  It would shock and frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge. . . .
I have given the letters.  I threw them through the bars of my window with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them in his cap.  I could do no more.  I stole back to the study, and began to read.  As the Count did not come in, I have written here . . .
The Count has come.  He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters, "The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they come, I shall, of course, take care.  See!"--He must have looked at it.--"One is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins.  The other,"--here he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly,--"The other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality!  It is not signed.  Well! So it cannot matter to us."  And he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he went on, "The letter to Hawkins, that I shall, of course send on, since it is yours.  Your letters are sacred to me.  Your pardon, my friend, that unknowingly I did break the seal.  Will you not cover it again?"  He held out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence.  When he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly.  A minute later I went over and tried it, and the door was locked. When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa.  He was very courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been sleeping, he said, "So, my friend, you are tired?  Get to bed.  There is the surest rest.  I may not have the pleasure of talk tonight, since there are many labours to me, but you will sleep, I pray." I passed to my room and went to bed, and, strange to say, slept without dreaming.  Despair has its own calms. 31 May.--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself with some papers and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a surprise, again a shock! Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda, relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that
might be useful to me were I once outside the castle.  I sat and pondered awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes. The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and rug.  I could find no trace of them anywhere.  This looked like some new scheme of villainy . . .
17 June.--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed cudgelling my brains, I heard without a crackling of whips and pounding and scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.  With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots.  They had also their long staves in hand.  I ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them.  Again a shock, my door was fastened on the outside. Then I ran to the window and cried to them.  They looked up at me stupidly and pointed, but just then the "hetman" of the Szgany came out, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonized entreaty, would make them even look at me.  They resolutely turned away.  The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick rope.  These were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on it for luck, lazily went each to his horse's head. Shortly afterwards, I heard the crackling of their whips die away in the distance.
24 June.--Last night the Count left me early, and locked himself into his own room.  As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened South.  I thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.  The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind.  I know it, for now and then, I hear a far-away muffled sound as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some ruthless villainy. I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw something coming out of the Count's window.  I drew back and watched carefully, and saw the whole man emerge.  It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I had seen the women take away.  There could be no doubt as to his quest, and in my garb, too!  This, then, is his new scheme of evil, that he will allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages
posting my own letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me. It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which is even a criminal's right and consolation. I thought I would watch for the Count's return, and for a long time sat doggedly at the window.  Then I began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight.  They were like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way.  I watched them with a sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me.  I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more fully the aerial gambolling. Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight.  Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating moats of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight.  I felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts.  Nay, my very soul was struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call.  I was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust.  The moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond.  More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes.  And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight, and where the lamp was burning brightly. When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the Count's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed.  And then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me.  With a beating heart, I tried the door, but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing.  I sat down and simply cried. As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without, the agonised cry of a woman.  I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered between the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running.  She was leaning against the corner of the gateway.  When she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace, "Monster, give me my child!" She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart.  Then she tore her hair and beat her breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion.  Finally, she threw herself forward, and though I could not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.
Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper.  His call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves.  Before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard. There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but short.  Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips. I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and she was better dead. What shall I do?  What can I do?  How can I escape from this dreadful thing of night, gloom, and fear?
25 June.--No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and dear to his heart and eye the morning can be.  When the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there.  My fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me.  Last night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth. Let me not think of it.  Action! It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear.  I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight.  Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that he may be awake whilst they sleep?  If I could only get into his room!  But there is no possible way.  The door is always locked, no way for me. Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it.  Where his body has gone why may not another body go?  I have seen him myself crawl from his window.  Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window?  The chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still.  I shall risk it.  At the worst it can only be death, and a man's death is not a calf's, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me.  God help me in my task!  Goodbye, Mina, if I fail.  Goodbye, my faithful friend and second father.  Goodbye, all, and last of all Mina!
Same day, later.--I have made the effort, and God helping me, have come safely back to this room.  I must put down every detail in order. I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side, and at once got outside on this side.  The stones are big and roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them.  I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way.  I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it.  I know pretty well the direction and distance of the Count's window, and made for it as well as I could, having regard to
the opportunities available.  I did not feel dizzy, I suppose I was too excited, and the time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window sill and trying to raise up the sash.  I was filled with agitation, however, when I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window.  Then I looked around for the Count, but with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.  The room was empty!  It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used. The furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust.  I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it anywhere.  The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one corner, gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained. At one corner of the room was a heavy door.  I tried it, for, since I could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or all my efforts would be in vain.  It was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended, minding carefully where I went for the stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry.  At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned.  As I went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier.  At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard.  The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made a search over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance.  I went down even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my very soul.  Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust.  In the third, however, I made a discovery. There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count!  He was either dead or asleep.  I could not say which, for eyes were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death, and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor.  The lips were as red as ever.  But there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain.  He could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.  By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.  I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them dead though they were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle wall.  Regaining my room, I
threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think.
29 June.--Today is the date of my last letter, and the Count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the castle by the same window, and in my clothes.  As he went down the wall, lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him.  But I fear that no weapon wrought along by man's hand would have any effect on him.  I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters.  I came back to the library, and read there till I fell asleep. I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man could look as he said, "Tomorrow, my friend, we must part.  You return to your beautiful England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet.  Your letter home has been despatched.  Tomorrow I shall not be here, but all shall be ready for your journey.  In the morning come the Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some Slovaks.  When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz.  But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula." I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.  Sincerity!  It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster, so I asked him point-blank, "Why may I not go tonight?" "Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission." "But I would walk with pleasure.  I want to get away at once." He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick behind his smoothness.  He said, "And your baggage?" "I do not care about it.  I can send for it some other time." The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes, it seemed so real, "You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is that which rules our boyars, 'Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.'  Come with me, my dear young friend.  Not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that you so suddenly desire it. Come!"  With a stately gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall.  Suddenly he stopped.  "Hark!" Close at hand came the howling of many wolves.  It was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the baton of the conductor.  After a pause of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it open. To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked.  Suspiciously, I looked all round, but could see no key of any kind. As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier.  Their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their
blunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door.  I knew than that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless.  With such allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door continued slowly to open, and only the Count's body stood in the gap.  Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom.  I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation.  There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and as the last chance I cried out, "Shut the door!  I shall wait till morning."  And I covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places. In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went to my own room.  The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me, with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of. When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a whispering at my door.  I went to it softly and listened.  Unless my ears deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count. "Back!  Back to your own place!  Your time is not yet come.  Wait! Have patience!  Tonight is mine.  Tomorrow night is yours!" There was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared, they all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away. I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees.  It is then so near the end?  Tomorrow!  Tomorrow!  Lord, help me, and those to whom I am dear!
30 June.--These may be the last words I ever write in this diary.  I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me ready. At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning had come.  Then came the welcome cockcrow, and I felt that I was safe.  With a glad heart, I opened the door and ran down the hall. I had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and threw back the massive bolts. But the door would not move.  Despair seized me.  I pulled and pulled at the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its casement.  I could see the bolt shot.  It had been locked after I left the Count. Then a wild desire took me to obtain the key at any risk, and I determined then and there to scale the wall again, and gain the Count's room.  He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of evils.  Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and
scrambled down the wall, as before, into the Count's room.  It was empty, but that was as I expected.  I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained.  I went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel.  I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought. The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall.  And then I saw something which filled my very soul with horror.  There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half restored.  For the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey.  The cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath.  The mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran down over the chin and neck.  Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated.  It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood.  He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact, but I had to search, or I was lost.  The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar war to those horrid three.  I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the key.  Then I stopped and looked at the Count.  There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad.  This was the being I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless. The very thought drove me mad.  A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster.  There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face.  But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror.  The sight seemed to paralyze me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead.  The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight.  The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell. I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me.  As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips.  The Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming.  With a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened. With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door.
There must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo.  I turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance, but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying.  When I ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast.  I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely. As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth.  There was a sound of hammering.  It is the box being nailed down.  Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall, with with many other idle feet coming behind them. The door is shut, the chains rattle.  There is a grinding of the key in the lock.  I can hear the key withdrawn, then another door opens and shuts.  I hear the creaking of lock and bolt. Hark!  In the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels, the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the distance. I am alone in the castle with those horrible women.  Faugh!  Mina is a woman, and there is nought in common.  They are devils of the Pit! I shall not remain alone with them.  I shall try to scale the castle wall farther than I have yet attempted.  I shall take some of the gold with me, lest I want it later.  I may find a way from this dreadful place. And then away for home!  Away to the quickest and nearest train!  Away from the cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet! At least God's mercy is better than that of those monsters, and the precipice is steep and high.  At its foot a man may sleep, as a man. Goodbye, all.  Mina!
CHAPTER 5
LETTER FROM MISS MINA MURRAY TO MISS LUCY WESTENRA 9 May. My dearest Lucy, Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed with work.  The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.  I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can
talk together freely and build our castles in the air.  I have been working very hard lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan's studies, and I have been practicing shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter, at which also I am practicing very hard. He and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad.  When I am with you I shall keep a diary in the same way.  I don't mean one of those two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezedin-a-corner diaries, but a sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people, but it is not intended for them.  I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book.  I shall try to do what I see lady journalists do, interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember conversations.  I am told that, with a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day. However, we shall see.  I will tell you of my little plans when we meet.  I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan from Transylvania.  He is well, and will be returning in about a week.  I am longing to hear all his news.  It must be nice to see strange countries.  I wonder if we, I mean Jonathan and I, shall ever see them together.  There is the ten o'clock bell ringing.  Goodbye. Your loving Mina
Tell me all the news when you write.  You have not told me anything for a long time.  I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome, curly-haired man???
LETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY
17, Chatham Street Wednesday My dearest Mina,
I must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I wrote you twice since we parted, and your last letter was only your second.  Besides, I have nothing to tell you.  There is really nothing to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a great deal to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park.  As
to the tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the last Pop.  Someone has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr. Holmwood.  He often comes to see us, and he and Mamma get on very well together, they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some time ago a man that would just do for you, if you were not already engaged to Jonathan.  He is an excellent parti, being handsome, well off, and of good birth.  He is a doctor and really clever.  Just fancy!  He is only nine-and twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care.  Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to see us, and often comes now.  I think he is one of the most resolute men I ever saw, and yet the most calm.  He seems absolutely imperturbable.  I can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients.  He has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to read one's thoughts.  He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack.  I know that from my glass. Do you ever try to read your own face?  I do, and I can tell you it is not a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological study, and I humbly think I do.  I do not, as you know, take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a bore.  That is slang again, but never mind.  Arthur says that every day. There, it is all out, Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other since we were children.  We have slept together and eaten together, and laughed and cried together, and now, though I have spoken, I would like to speak more.  Oh, Mina, couldn't you guess?  I love him.  I am blushing as I write, for although I think he loves me, he has not told me so in words.  But, oh, Mina, I love him.  I love him!  There, that does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire undressing, as we used to sit, and I would try to tell you what I feel.  I do not know how I am writing this even to you.  I am afraid to stop, or I should tear up the letter, and I don't want to stop, for I do so want to tell you all. Let me hear from you at once, and tell me all that you think about it.  Mina, pray for my happiness. Lucy
P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Goodnight again.  L.
LETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA MURRAY
24 May My dearest Mina, Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter.  It was so nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy. My dear, it never rains but it pours.  How true the old proverbs are.  Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a proposal till today, not a real proposal, and today I had three.  Just fancy!  Three proposals in one day!  Isn't it awful!  I feel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don't know what to do with myself. And three proposals!  But, for goodness' sake, don't tell any of the girls, or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas, and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at least.  Some girls are so vain!  You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can despise vanity.  Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep it a secret, dear, from every one except, of course, Jonathan.  You will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell Arthur.  A woman ought to tell her husband everything.  Don't you think so, dear?  And I must be fair.  Men like women, certainly their wives, to be quite as fair as they are.  And women, I am afraid, are not always quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just before lunch.  I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic asylum man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead.  He was very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same.  He had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them, but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don't generally do when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream.  He spoke to me, Mina, very straightforwardly.  He told me how dear I was to him, though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him.  He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble.  Then he broke off and asked if I could love him in time, and when I shook my head his hands trembled, and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one else.  He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was free a man might have hope.  And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one.  I only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that If I ever wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can't help crying, and you must excuse this letter being all blotted.  Being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken hearted, and to know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing out of his life.  My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.
Evening. Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two came after lunch.  He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has been to so many places and has such adventures.  I sympathize with poor Desdemona when she had such a stream poured in her ear, even by a black man.  I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him.  I know now what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me.  No, I don't, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never told any, and yet . . . My dear, I am somewhat previous.  Mr. Quincy P. Morris found me alone.  It seems that a man always does find a girl alone.  No, he doesn't, for Arthur tried twice to make a chance, and I helping him all I could, I am not ashamed to say it now.  I must tell you beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn't always speak slang, that is to say, he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well educated and has exquisite manners, but he found out that it amused me to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things.  I am afraid, my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say.  But this is a way slang has.  I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang.  I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was very nervous.  He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly . . . "Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit.  Won't you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road together, driving in double harness?" Well, he did look so good humoured and so jolly that it didn't seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward.  So I said, as lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I wasn't broken to harness at all yet.  Then he said that he had spoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, and occasion for him, I would forgive him.  He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number Two in one day.  And then, my dear, before I could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very heart and soul at my feet.  He looked so earnest over it that I shall never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest, because he is merry at times.  I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free . . .
"Lucy, you are an honest hearted girl, I know.  I should not be here speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right through to the very depths of your soul.  Tell me, like one good fellow to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is I'll never trouble you a hair's breadth again, but will be, if you will let me, a very faithful friend." My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them?  Here was I almost making fun of this great hearted, true gentleman.  I burst into tears, I am afraid, my dear, you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one, and I really felt very badly. Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all this trouble?  But this is heresy, and I must not say it.  I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into Mr. Morris' brave eyes, and I told him out straight . . . "Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he even loves me."  I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine, I think I put them into his, and said in a hearty way . . . "That's my brave girl.  It's better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don't cry, my dear.  If it's for me, I'm a hard nut to crack, and I take it standing up.  If that other fellow doesn't know his happiness, well, he'd better look for it soon, or he'll have to deal with me.  Little girl, your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that's rarer than a lover, it's more selfish anyhow.  My dear, I'm going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come.  Won't you give me one kiss?  It'll be something to keep off the darkness now and then.  You can, you know, if you like, for that other good fellow, or you could not love him, hasn't spoken yet." That quite won me, Mina, for it was brave and sweet of him, and noble too, to a rival, wasn't it?  And he so sad, so I leant over and kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down into my face, I am afraid I was blushing very much, he said, "Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these things don't make us friends nothing ever will.  Thank you for your sweet honesty to me, and goodbye." He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a quiver or a pause, and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on?  I know I would if I were free, only I don't want to be free.  My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it, and I don't wish to tell of the number Three until it can be all happy.  Ever your loving . . .
Lucy
P.S.--Oh, about number Three, I needn't tell you of number Three, need I?  Besides, it was all so confused.  It seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was kissing me.  I am very, very happy, and I don't know what I have done to deserve it.  I must only try in the future to show that I am not ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a lover, such a husband, and such a friend. Goodbye.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY (Kept in phonograph) 25 May.--Ebb tide in appetite today.  Cannot eat, cannot rest, so diary instead.  Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty feeling.  Nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing.  As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work, I went amongst the patients.  I picked out one who has afforded me a study of much interest.  He is so quaint that I am determined to understand him as well as I can.  Today I seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery. I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making myself master of the facts of his hallucination.  In my manner of doing it there was, I now see, something of cruelty.  I seemed to wish to keep him to the point of his madness, a thing which I avoid with the patients as I would the mouth of hell. (Mem., Under what circumstances would I not avoid the pit of hell?) Omnia Romae venalia sunt.  Hell has its price!  If there be anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards accurately, so I had better commence to do so, therefore . . . R. M, Renfield, age 59.  Sanguine temperament, great physical strength, morbidly excitable, periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I cannot make out.  I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish, a possibly dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish.  In selfish men caution is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves.  What I think of on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal.  When duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of accidents can balance it.
LETTER, QUINCEY P. MORRIS TO HON.  ARTHUR HOLMOOD 25 May. My dear Art, We've told yarns by the campfire in the prairies, and dressed one
another's wounds after trying a landing at the Marquesas, and drunk healths on the shore of Titicaca.  There are more yarns to be told, and other wounds to be healed, and another health to be drunk. Won't you let this be at my campfire tomorrow night?  I have no hesitation in asking you, as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinner party, and that you are free.  There will only be one other, our old pal at the Korea, Jack Seward.  He's coming, too, and we both want to mingle our weeps over the wine cup, and to drink a health with all our hearts to the happiest man in all the wide world, who has won the noblest heart that God has made and best worth winning.  We promise you a hearty welcome, and a loving greeting, and a health as true as your own right hand.  We shall both swear to leave you at home if you drink too deep to a certain pair of eyes.  Come! Yours, as ever and always, Quincey P. Morris
TELEGRAM FROM ARTHUR HOLMWOOD TO QUINCEY P. MORRIS 26 May
Count me in every time.  I bear messages which will make both your ears tingle. Art
CHAPTER 6
MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL 24 July.  Whitby.--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in which they have rooms.  This is a lovely place.  The little river, the Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the harbour.  A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is.  The valley is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to see down.  The houses of the old town--the side away from us, are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg.  Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of "Marmion," where the girl was built up in the wall.  It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits.  There is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows.  Between it and the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones.
This is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea.  It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below.  There are walks, with seats beside them, through the churchyard, and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and sit here often myself and work.  Indeed, I am writing now, with my book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me.  They seem to do nothing all day but sit here and talk. The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in the middle of which is a lighthouse.  A heavy seawall runs along outside of it.  On the near side, the seawall makes an elbow crooked inversely, and its end too has a lighthouse.  Between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens. It is nice at high water, but when the tide is out it shoals away to nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between banks of sand, with rocks here and there.  Outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse.  At the end of it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea.  I must ask the old man about this.  He is coming this way . . . He is a funny old man.  He must be awfully old, for his face is gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree.  He tells me that he is nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought.  He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady at the abbey he said very brusquely, "I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss.  Them things be all wore out.  Mind, I don't say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn't in my time.  They be all very well for comers and trippers, an' the like, but not for a nice young lady like you.  Them feet-folks from York and Leeds that be always eatin' cured herrin's and drinkin' tea an' lookin' out to buy cheap jet would creed aught.  I wonder masel' who'd be bothered tellin' lies to them, even the newspapers, which is full of fool-talk." I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whale fishing in the old days.  He was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said, "I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss.  My grand-daughter doesn't like to be kept waitin' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to
crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of 'em, and miss, I lack belly-timber sairly by the clock." He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down the steps.  The steps are a great feature on the place.  They lead from the town to the church, there are hundreds of them, I do not know how many, and they wind up in a delicate curve.  The slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too.  Lucy went out, visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did not go.
1 August.--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come and join him.  He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit anything, and down faces everybody.  If he can't out-argue them he bullies them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock.  She has got a beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming and sitting near her when we sat down.  She is so sweet with old people, I think they all fell in love with her on the spot.  Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but gave me double share instead.  I got him on the subject of the legends, and he went off at once into a sort of sermon.  I must try to remember it and put it down. "It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel, that's what it be and nowt else.  These bans an' wafts an' boh-ghosts an' bar-guests an' bogles an' all anent them is only fit to set bairns an' dizzy women a'belderin'.  They be nowt but air-blebs.  They, an' all grims an' signs an' warnin's, be all invented by parsons an' illsome berk-bodies an' railway touters to skeer an' scunner hafflin's, an' to get folks to do somethin' that they don't other incline to.  It makes me ireful to think o' them.  Why, it's them that, not content with printin' lies on paper an' preachin' them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin' them on the tombstones.  Look here all around you in what airt ye will.  All them steans, holdin' up their heads as well as they can out of their pride, is acant, simply tumblin' down with the weight o' the lies wrote on them, 'Here lies the body' or 'Sacred to the memory' wrote on all of them, an' yet in nigh half of them there bean't no bodies at all, an' the memories of them bean't cared a pinch of snuff about, much less sacred.  Lies all of them, nothin' but lies of one kind or another!  My gog, but it'll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they come tumblin' up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an' trying' to drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was, some of them trimmlin' an' dithering, with their hands that dozzened an' slippery from lyin' in the sea that they can't even keep their gurp o' them." I could see from the old fellow's self-satisfied air and the way in which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was
"showing off," so I put in a word to keep him going. "Oh, Mr. Swales, you can't be serious.  Surely these tombstones are not all wrong?" "Yabblins!  There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin' where they make out the people too good, for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be like the sea, if only it be their own.  The whole thing be only lies.  Now look you here.  You come here a stranger, an' you see this kirkgarth." I nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite understand his dialect.  I knew it had something to do with the church. He went on, "And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be haped here, snod an' snog?"  I assented again.  "Then that be just where the lie comes in.  Why, there be scores of these laybeds that be toom as old Dun's 'baccabox on Friday night." He nudged one of his companions, and they all laughed.  "And, my gog! How could they be otherwise?  Look at that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank, read it!" I went over and read, "Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854, age 30."  When I came back Mr. Swales went on, "Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here?  Murdered off the coast of Andres!  An' you consated his body lay under!  Why, I could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above," he pointed northwards, "or where the currants may have drifted them. There be the steans around ye.  Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small print of the lies from here.  This Braithwaite Lowery, I knew his father, lost in the Lively off Greenland in '20, or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777, or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later, or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of Finland in '50.  Do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds?  I have me antherums aboot it!  I tell ye that when they got here they'd be jommlin' and jostlin' one another that way that it 'ud be like a fight up on the ice in the old days, when we'd be at one another from daylight to dark, an' tryin' to tie up our cuts by the aurora borealis."  This was evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his cronies joined in with gusto. "But," I said, "surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment.  Do you think that will be really necessary?" "Well, what else be they tombstones for?  Answer me that, miss!" "To please their relatives, I suppose." "To please their relatives, you suppose!"  This he said with intense scorn.  "How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be
lies?" He pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff.  "Read the lies on that thruff-stone," he said. The letters were upside down to me from where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over and read, "Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a glorious resurrection, on July 29,1873, falling from the rocks at Kettleness.  This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son.  'He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.'  Really, Mr. Swales, I don't see anything very funny in that!"  She spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely. "Ye don't see aught funny!  Ha-ha!  But that's because ye don't gawm the sorrowin' mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was acrewk'd, a regular lamiter he was, an' he hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightn't get an insurance she put on his life.  He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that they had for scarin' crows with.  'Twarn't for crows then, for it brought the clegs and the dowps to him.  That's the way he fell off the rocks.  And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I've often heard him say masel' that he hoped he'd go to hell, for his mother was so pious that she'd be sure to go to heaven, an' he didn't want to addle where she was.  Now isn't that stean at any rate," he hammered it with his stick as he spoke, "a pack of lies?  And won't it make Gabriel keckle when Geordie comes pantin' ut the grees with the tompstean balanced on his hump, and asks to be took as evidence!" I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she said, rising up, "Oh, why did you tell us of this?  It is my favourite seat, and I cannot leave it, and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a suicide." "That won't harm ye, my pretty, an' it may make poor Geordie gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin' on his lap.  That won't hurt ye.  Why, I've sat here off an' on for nigh twenty years past, an' it hasn't done me no harm.  Don't ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn' lie there either!  It'll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field.  There's the clock, and I must gang.  My service to ye, ladies!"  And off he hobbled. Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we took hands as we sat, and she told me all over again about Arthur and their coming marriage.  That made me just a little heart-sick, for I haven't heard from Jonathan for a whole month.
The same day.  I came up here alone, for I am very sad.  There was no letter for me.  I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.  The clock has just struck nine.  I see the lights scattered all over the town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly.  They run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley.  To my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next to the abbey.  The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind me, and there is a clatter of donkeys' hoofs
up the paved road below.  The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.  Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them both.  I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me!  I wish he were here.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 5 June.--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to understand the man.  He has certain qualities very largely developed, selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the object of the latter.  He seems to have some settled scheme of his own, but what it is I do not know. His redeeming quality is a love of animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel.  His pets are of odd sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies.  He has at present such a quantity that I have had myself to expostulate.  To my astonishment, he did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in simple seriousness.  He thought for a moment, and then said, "May I have three days?  I shall clear them away."  Of course, I said that would do.  I must watch him.
18 June.--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several very big fellows in a box.  He keeps feeding them his flies, and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room.
1 July.--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies, and today I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked very sad at this, so I said that he must some of them, at all events.  He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a horrid blowfly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb, and before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome, that it was life, strong life, and gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one.  I must watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he keeps a little notebook in which he is always jotting down something.  Whole pages of it are filled with masses of figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the totals added in batches again, as though he were focussing some account, as the auditors put it.
8 July.--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in my mind is growing.  It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh, unconscious cerebration, you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I might notice if there were any change.  Things remain as they were except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished.  Those that do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by tempting them with his food. 19 July--We are progressing.  My friend has now a whole colony of sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated.  When I came in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour, a very, very great favour.  And as he spoke, he fawned on me like a dog. I asked him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and bearing, "A kitten, a nice, little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with, and teach, and feed, and feed, and feed!" I was not unprepared for this request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and spiders.  So I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered, "Oh, yes, I would like a cat!  I only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat.  No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?" I shook my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but that I would see about it.  His face fell, and I could see a warning of danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant killing.  The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac.  I shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out, then I shall know more.
10 pm.--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner brooding.  When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat, that his salvation depended upon it. I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner where I had found him.  I shall see him in the morning early.
20 July.--Visited Renfield very early, before attendant went his rounds.  Found him up and humming a tune.  He was spreading out his sugar, which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his fly catching again, and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where
they were.  He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.  There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood.  I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if there were anything odd about him during the day.
11 am.--The attendant has just been to see me to say that Renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers.  "My belief is, doctor," he said, "that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took and ate them raw!"
11 pm.--I gave Renfield a strong opiate tonight, enough to make even him sleep, and took away his pocketbook to look at it.  The thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind.  I shall have to invent a new classification for him, and call him a zoophagous (life-eating) maniac.  What he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way.  He gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds.  What would have been his later steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment.  It might be done if there were only a sufficient cause.  Men sneered at vivisection, and yet look at its results today!  Why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect, the knowledge of the brain? Had I even the secret of one such mind, did I hold the key to the fancy of even one lunatic, I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which Burdon-Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's brain knowledge would be as nothing.  If only there were a sufficient cause!  I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted.  A good cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally? How well the man reasoned.  Lunatics always do within their own scope. I wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one.  He has closed the account most accurately, and today begun a new record.  How many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives? To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope, and that truly I began a new record.  So it shall be until the Great Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours, but I must only wait on hopeless and work.  Work!  Work! If I could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there, a good, unselfish cause to make me work, that would be indeed happiness.
MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL
26 July.--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here.  It is like whispering to one's self and listening at the same time.  And there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing.  I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned, but yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from him.  I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed had just been received.  It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula, and says that he is just starting for home.  That is not like Jonathan.  I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy, although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in her sleep.  Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy's father, had the same habit, that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged.  I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood, he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord Godalming, is coming up here very shortly, as soon as he can leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is counting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up in the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby.  I daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her.  She will be all right when he arrives.
27 July.--No news from Jonathan.  I am getting quite uneasy about him, though why I should I do not know, but I do wish that he would write, if it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I am awakened by her moving about the room.  Fortunately, the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold.  But still, the anxiety and the perpetually being awakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and wakeful myself.  Thank God, Lucy's health keeps up.  Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously ill.  Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch her looks.  She is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely rose-pink.  She has lost the anemic look which she had.  I pray it will all last.
3 August.--Another week gone by, and no news from Jonathan, not even
to Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard.  Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He surely would have written.  I look at that last letter of his, but somehow it does not satisfy me.  It does not read like him, and yet it is his writing.  There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her which I do not understand, even in her sleep she seems to be watching me.  She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room searching for the key.
6 August.--Another three days, and no news.  This suspense is getting dreadful.  If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should feel easier.  But no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last letter.  I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable than ever, but is otherwise well.  Last night was very threatening, and the fishermen say that we are in for a storm.  I must try to watch it and learn the weather signs. Today is a gray day, and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness.  Everything is gray except the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it, gray earthy rock, gray clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the gray sea, into which the sandpoints stretch like gray figures.  The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland.  The horizon is lost in a gray mist.  All vastness, the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there is a 'brool' over the sea that sounds like some passage of doom.  Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem 'men like trees walking'.  The fishing boats are racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers.  Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that he wants to talk. I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man.  When he sat down beside me, he said in a very gentle way, "I want to say something to you, miss." I could see he was not at ease, so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak fully. So he said, leaving his hand in mine, "I'm afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked things I've been sayin' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past, but I didn't mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I'm gone.  We aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don't altogether like to think of it, and we don't want to feel scart of it, and that's why I've took to makin' light of it, so that I'd cheer up my own heart a bit.  But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of dyin', not a bit, only I don't want to die if I can help it.  My time must be nigh at hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to expect.  And I'm so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin' his scythe.  Ye see, I can't get out o' the habit of caffin' about it all at once. The chafts will wag as they be used to.  Some day soon the Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me.  But don't ye dooal an' greet, my deary!"--for he saw that I was crying--"if he should come this very
night I'd not refuse to answer his call.  For life be, after all, only a waitin' for somethin' else than what we're doin', and death be all that we can rightly depend on.  But I'm content, for it's comin' to me, my deary, and comin' quick.  It may be comin' while we be lookin' and wonderin'.  Maybe it's in that wind out over the sea that's bringin' with it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look!  Look!" he cried suddenly.  "There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death.  It's in the air.  I feel it comin'.  Lord, make me answer cheerful, when my call comes!"  He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat.  His mouth moved as though he were praying.  After a few minutes' silence, he got up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said goodbye, and hobbled off.  It all touched me, and upset me very much. I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spyglass under his arm.  He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time kept looking at a strange ship. "I can't make her out," he said.  "She's a Russian, by the look of her.  But she's knocking about in the queerest way.  She doesn't know her mind a bit.  She seems to see the storm coming, but can't decide whether to run up north in the open, or to put in here.  Look there again!  She is steered mighty strangely, for she doesn't mind the hand on the wheel, changes about with every puff of wind.  We'll hear more of her before this time tomorrow."
CHAPTER 7
CUTTING FROM "THE DAILYGRAPH", 8 AUGUST
(PASTED IN MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL)
From a correspondent. Whitby. One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here, with results both strange and unique.  The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of August.  Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in the neighborhood of Whitby.  The steamers Emma and Scarborough made trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of 'tripping' both to and from Whitby.  The day was unusually fine till the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from the commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of 'mares tails' high in the sky to the northwest.  The wind was then blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked 'No. 2, light
breeze.' The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm.  The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty.  Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset colour, flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold, with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes.  The experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the 'Prelude to the Great Storm' will grace the R. A and R. I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and there that his 'cobble' or his 'mule', as they term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.  The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers, which usually hug the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few fishing boats were in sight.  The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in the face of her danger.  Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea. "As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean." Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a dischord in the great harmony of nature's silence.  A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming. Then without warning the tempest broke.  With a rapidity which, at the time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed.  The waves rose in growing fury, each over-topping its fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.  White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs.  Others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet, or clung with
grim clasp to the iron stanchions.  It was found necessary to clear the entire pier from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have increased manifold.  To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland.  White, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, which came thick and fast, followed by such peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm. Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest.  The sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space.  Here and there a fishing boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast, now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed seabird.  On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried.  The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in the pauses of onrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.  Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing boat, with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on the shore, a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush. Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening.  The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter, it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old salt, "she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in hell".  Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto, a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a gray pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before.  The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the northeast, and the remnant of the sea fog melted in the blast.  And then, mirabile dictu, between the
piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour.  The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship.  No other form could be seen on the deck at all. A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man!  However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words.  The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the southeast corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier. There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap.  Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the 'top-hammer' came crashing down.  But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones, thruffsteans or through-stones, as they call them in Whitby vernacular, actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight. It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above.  Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb aboard.  The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there.  The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion.  This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Draw-bridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.  When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board.  By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel. It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen.  The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel.  Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords.  The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the
sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and had dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor, Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place, who came immediately after me, declared, after making examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his teeth.  The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications later on, in the Admiralty Court, for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict.  Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the statues of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a dead hand. It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death, a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca, and placed in the mortuary to await inquest. Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating.  Crowds are scattering backward, and the sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm.
9 August.--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself.  It turns out that the schooner is Russian from Varna, and is called the Demeter.  She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount of cargo, a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould. This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S.F. Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and took formal possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here today except the strange coincidence. The officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations.  As the matter is to be a 'nine days wonder', they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of other complaint.
A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the S.P.C.A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the animal.  To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found.  It seems to have disappeared entirely from the town.  It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it is evidently a fierce brute.  Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite its master's yard.  It had been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away, and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw. Later.--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been permitted to look over the log book of the Demeter, which was in order up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men.  The greatest interest, however, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was today produced at the inquest.  And a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a transcript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo.  It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage.  Of course my statement must be taken cum grano, since I am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for me, time being short.
  LOG OF THE "DEMETER" Varna to Whitby
  Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall  keep accurate note henceforth till we land.
  On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes  of earth.  At noon set sail.  East wind, fresh.  Crew, five  hands . . . two mates, cook, and myself, (captain).
  On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus.  Boarded by Turkish  Customs officers.  Backsheesh.  All correct.  Under way at  4 p.m.
  On 12 July through Dardanelles.  More Customs officers and  flagboat of guarding squadron.  Backsheesh again.  Work of  officers thorough, but quick.  Want us off soon.  At dark  passed into Archipelago.
  On 13 July passed Cape Matapan.  Crew dissatisfied about  something.  Seemed scared, but would not speak out.
  On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew.  Men all steady  fellows, who sailed with me before.  Mate could not make out what  was wrong.  They only told him there was SOMETHING, and crossed  themselves.  Mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck  him.  Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet.
  On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of the  crew, Petrofsky, was missing.  Could not account for it.  Took larboard watch eight bells last night, was relieved by  Amramoff, but did not go to bunk.  Men more downcast than  ever.  All said they expected something of the kind, but  would not say more than there was SOMETHING aboard.  Mate  getting very impatient with them.  Feared some trouble  ahead.
  On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin,  and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a  strange man aboard the ship.  He said that in his watch he had  been sheltering behind the deckhouse, as there was a rain storm,  when he saw a tall, thin man, who was not like any of the crew,  come up the companionway, and go along the deck forward and  disappear.  He followed cautiously, but when he got to bows found  no one, and the hatchways were all closed.  He was in a panic of  superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may spread.  To  allay it, I shall today search the entire ship carefully from stem  to stern.
  Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as  they evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would  search from stem to stern.  First mate angry, said it was folly,  and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men, said  he would engage to keep them out of trouble with the handspike.  I  let him take the helm, while the rest began a thorough search, all  keeping abreast, with lanterns.  We left no corner unsearched.  As  there were only the big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners  where a man could hide.  Men much relieved when search over, and  went back to work cheerfully.  First mate scowled, but said  nothing.
  22 July.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy  with sails, no time to be frightened.  Men seem to have  forgotten their dread.  Mate cheerful again, and all on  good terms.  Praised men for work in bad weather.  Passed  Gibraltar and out through Straits.  All well.
  24 July.--There seems some doom over this ship.  Already a hand  short, and entering the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and  yet last night another man lost, disappeared.  Like the first, he
  came off his watch and was not seen again.  Men all in a panic of  fear, sent a round robin, asking to have double watch, as they  fear to be alone.  Mate angry.  Fear there will be some trouble,  as either he or the men will do some violence.
  28 July.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of  maelstrom, and the wind a tempest.  No sleep for any one.  Men all worn out.  Hardly know how to set a watch, since no  one fit to go on.  Second mate volunteered to steer and  watch, and let men snatch a few hours sleep.  Wind abating,  seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is  steadier.
  29 July.--Another tragedy.  Had single watch tonight, as crew too  tired to double.  When morning watch came on deck could find no  one except steersman.  Raised outcry, and all came on deck.  Thorough search, but no one found.  Are now without second mate,  and crew in a panic.  Mate and I agreed to go armed henceforth and  wait for any sign of cause.
  30 July.--Last night.  Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather  fine, all sails set.  Retired worn out, slept soundly, awakened by  mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing.  Only self and mate and two hands left to work ship.  1 August.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted.  Had hoped  when in the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get  in somewhere.  Not having power to work sails, have to run before  wind.  Dare not lower, as could not raise them again.  We seem to  be drifting to some terrible doom.  Mate now more demoralised than  either of men.  His stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly  against himself.  Men are beyond fear, working stolidly and  patiently, with minds made up to worst.  They are Russian, he  Roumanian.  2 August, midnight.--Woke up from few minutes sleep by hearing a  cry, seemingly outside my port.  Could see nothing in fog.  Rushed  on deck, and ran against mate. Tells me he heard cry and ran, but  no sign of man on watch.  One more gone.  Lord, help us!  Mate  says we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog  lifting he saw North Foreland, just as he heard the man cry out.  If so we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide us  in the fog, which seems to move with us, and God seems to have  deserted us.
  3 August.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the  wheel and when I got to it found no one there.  The wind  was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing.  I  dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate.  After a few  seconds, he rushed up on deck in his flannels.  He looked  wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has  given way.  He came close to me and whispered hoarsely,  with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air  might hear.  "It is here.  I know it now.  On the watch
  last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly  pale.  It was in the bows, and looking out.  I crept behind  It, and gave it my knife, but the knife went through It,  empty as the air."  And as he spoke he took the knife and  drove it savagely into space.  Then he went on, "But It is  here, and I'll find It.  It is in the hold, perhaps in one  of those boxes.  I'll unscrew them one by one and see.  You  work the helm."  And with a warning look and his finger on  his lip, he went below.  There was springing up a choppy  wind, and I could not leave the helm.  I saw him come out  on deck again with a tool chest and lantern, and go down  the forward hatchway.  He is mad, stark, raving mad, and  it's no use my trying to stop him.  He can't hurt those big  boxes, they are invoiced as clay, and to pull them about is  as harmless a thing as he can do.  So here I stay and mind  the helm, and write these notes.  I can only trust in God  and wait till the fog clears.  Then, if I can't steer to  any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails,  and lie by, and signal for help . . .  It is nearly all over now.  Just as I was beginning to hope  that the mate would come out calmer, for I heard him  knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good  for him, there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled  scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he  came as if shot from a gun, a raging madman, with his eyes  rolling and his face convulsed with fear.  "Save me!  Save  me!" he cried, and then looked round on the blanket of fog.  His horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he  said, "You had better come too, captain, before it is too  late.  He is there!  I know the secret now.  The sea will  save me from Him, and it is all that is left!"  Before I  could say a word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang  on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea.  I suppose I know the secret too, now.  It was this madman  who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has  followed them himself.  God help me!  How am I to account  for all these horrors when I get to port?  When I get to  port!  Will that ever be?
  4 August.--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce, I  know there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I  know not.  I dared not go below, I dared not leave the  helm, so here all night I stayed, and in the dimness of the  night I saw it, Him!  God, forgive me, but the mate was  right to jump overboard.  It was better to die like a man.  To die like a sailor in blue water, no man can object.  But  I am captain, and I must not leave my ship.  But I shall  baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie my hands to  the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with  them I shall tie that which He, It, dare not touch.  And  then, come good wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my  honour as a captain.  I am growing weaker, and the night is  coming on.  If He can look me in the face again, I may not  have time to act. . .  If we are wrecked, mayhap this bottle  may be found, and those who find it may understand.  If  not . . . well, then all men shall know that I have been
  true to my trust.  God and the Blessed Virgin and the  Saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty . . .
Of course the verdict was an open one.  There is no evidence to adduce, and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now none to say.  The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral.  Already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey steps, for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff.  The owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as wishing to follow him to the grave. No trace has ever been found of the great dog, at which there is much mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I believe, be adopted by the town.  Tomorrow will see the funeral, and so will end this one more 'mystery of the sea'.
MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL 8 August.--Lucy was very restless all night, and I too, could not sleep.  The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the chimney pots, it made me shudder.  When a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun.  Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake, but she got up twice and dressed herself.  Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed.  It is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any, disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life. Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night.  There were very few people about, and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big, grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the mouth of the harbour, like a bullying man going through a crowd.  Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But, oh, is he on land or sea?  Where is he, and how?  I am getting fearfully anxious about him.  If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!
10 August.--The funeral of the poor sea captain today was most touching.  Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard.  Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortege of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again.  We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.  The poor fellow was laid to rest near our seat so that we stood on it, when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.  She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her.
She is quite odd in one thing.  She will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness, or if there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional cause in that poor Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being broken.  He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder.  Poor dear old man! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do.  Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.  The dog is always with him.  They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark.  During the service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling.  Its master spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily.  But it would neither come nor cease to make a noise.  It was in a fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hair bristling out like a cat's tail when puss is on the war path. Finally the man too got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed.  The moment it touched the stone the poor thing began to tremble.  It did not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect, to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way.  I greatly fear that she is of too super sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble.  She will be dreaming of this tonight, I am sure.  The whole agglomeration of things, the ship steered into port by a dead man, his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads, the touching funeral, the dog, now furious and now in terror, will all afford material for her dreams. I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood's Bay and back.  She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.
CHAPTER 8
MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL Same day, 11 o'clock P.M.--Oh, but I am tired!  If it were not that I had made my diary a duty I should not open it tonight.  We had a lovely walk.  Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us.  I believe we forgot everything, except of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the
slate clean and give us a fresh start.  We had a capital 'severe tea' at Robin Hood's Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand.  I believe we should have shocked the 'New Woman' with our appetites.  Men are more tolerant, bless them!  Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.  The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper.  Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller.  I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic.  I think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how hard they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and breathing softly.  She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and looks, oh so sweet.  If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawing room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.  Some of the 'New Women' writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting.  But I suppose the 'New Woman' won't condescend in future to accept.  She will do the proposing herself.  And a nice job she will make of it too!  There's some consolation in that. I am so happy tonight, because dear Lucy seems better.  I really believe she has turned the corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming.  I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan . . . God bless and keep him.
11 August.--Diary again.  No sleep now, so I may as well write.  I am too agitated to sleep.  We have had such an adventure, such an agonizing experience.  I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary. . . .  Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me.  The room was dark, so I could not see Lucy's bed.  I stole across and felt for her.  The bed was empty.  I lit a match and found that she was not in the room.  The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it.  I feared to wake her mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her.  As I was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention.  Dressing-gown would mean house, dress outside. Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places.  "Thank God," I said to myself, "she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress." I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting room.  Not there!  Then I looked in all the other rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart.  Finally, I came to the hall door and found it open. It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught.  The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was.  There was no time to think of what might happen.  A vague over-mastering fear obscured all details. I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out.  The clock was striking one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight.  I ran along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I
expected.  At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear, I don't know which, of seeing Lucy in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across.  For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church and all around it.  Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view, and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along, the church and churchyard became gradually visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white.  The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately, but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it.  What it was, whether man or beast, I could not tell. I did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East Cliff.  The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see.  I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy's condition.  The time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey.  I must have gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow.  There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the half-reclining white figure.  I called in fright, "Lucy!  Lucy!" and something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her.  When I came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat.  She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about. When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep.  Her lips were parted, and she was breathing, not softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath.  As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her, as though she felt the cold.  I flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight around her neck, for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air, unclad as she was.  I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to have my hands free to help her, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety pin.  But I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned.  When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet, and then began very gently to wake her.
At first she did not respond, but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally.  At last, as time was passing fast, and for many other reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her forcibly, till finally she opened her eyes and awoke.  She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not realize all at once where she was. Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace.  She trembled a little, and clung to me.  When I told her to come at once with me home, she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes, but I would not.  However, when we got to the pathway outside the chruchyard, where there was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet. Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul.  Once we saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of us.  But we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or 'wynds', as they call them in Scotland.  My heart beat so loud all the time sometimes I thought I should faint.  I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation in case the story should get wind.  When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed.  Before falling asleep she asked, even implored, me not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I hesitated at first, to promise, but on thinking of the state of her mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and think too, of how such a story might become distorted, nay, infallibly would, in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so.  I hope I did right.  I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed.  Lucy is sleeping soundly.  The reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea . . .
Same day, noon.--All goes well.  Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side.  The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her, on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks.  I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her.  Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced.  I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood.  When I apologised and was concerned about it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.
Same day, night.--We passed a happy day.  The air was clear, and the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze.  We took our lunch to Mulgrave
Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the cliff-path and joining her at the gate.  I felt a little sad myself, for I could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had Jonathan been with me.  But there!  I must only be patient.  In the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early.  Lucy seems more restful than she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once.  I shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any trouble tonight.
12 August.--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I was wakened by Lucy trying to get out.  She seemed, even in her sleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed under a sort of protest.  I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds chirping outside of the window.  Lucy woke, too, and I was glad to see, was even better than on the previous morning.  All her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur.  I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me.  Well, she succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy can't alter facts, it can make them more bearable.
13 August.--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as before.  Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window.  I got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind, looked out.  It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky, merged together in one great silent mystery, was beautiful beyond words.  Between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles.  Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey.  When I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.  She did not stir again all night.
14 August.--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day.  Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner.  This afternoon she made a funny remark.  We were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do.  The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness.  The red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow.  We were silent for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself . . . "His red eyes again!  They are just the same."  It was such an odd expression, coming apropos of nothing, that it quite startled me.  I slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that she was in a half dreamy state, with an odd look on her face that I could not quite make out, so I said nothing, but followed her eyes.  She appeared to be looking over at our own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone.  I was quite a little startled myself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames, but a second look dispelled the illusion.  The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our
seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved.  I called Lucy's attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself with a start, but she looked sad all the same.  It may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there.  We never refer to it, so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner.  Lucy had a headache and went early to bed.  I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself. I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan.  When coming home, it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen, I threw a glance up at our window, and saw Lucy's head leaning out.  I opened my handkerchief and waved it.  She did not notice or make any movement whatever.  Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell on the window.  There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the window sill and her eyes shut.  She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window sill, was something that looked like a good-sized bird.  I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily.  She was holding her hand to her throat, as though to protect if from the cold. I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly.  I have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened. She looks so sweet as she sleeps, but she is paler than is her wont, and there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I fear she is fretting about something.  I wish I could find out what it is.
15 August.--Rose later than usual.  Lucy was languid and tired, and slept on after we had been called.  We had a happy surprise at breakfast.  Arthur's father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon.  Lucy is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once.  Later on in the day she told me the cause.  She is grieved to lose Lucy as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her.  Poor dear, sweet lady!  She confided to me that she has got her death warrant.  She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy.  Her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weakening.  At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her.  Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of Lucy's sleep-walking.
17 August.--No diary for two whole days.  I have not had the heart to write.  Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.  No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her mother's hours are numbering to a close.  I do not understand Lucy's fading away as she is doing.  She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air, but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid day by day. At night I hear her gasping as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open window.
Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried to wake her I could not. She was in a faint.  When I managed to restore her, she was weak as water, and cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin.  I looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.  They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the edges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with red centres.  Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about them.

MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL. 18 August.--I am happy today, and write sitting on the seat in the churchyard.  Lucy is ever so much better.  Last night she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking.  If she were in any way anemic I could understand it, but she is not.  She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness.  All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I needed any reminding, of that night, and that it was here, on this very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said, "My poor little feet didn't make much noise then!  I daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was because I didn't want to wake up Geordie." As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead, which Arthur, I call him Arthur from her habit, says he loves, and indeed, I don't wonder that he does.  Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to herself. "I didn't quite dream, but it all seemed to be real.  I only wanted to be here in this spot.  I don't know why, for I was afraid of something, I don't know what.  I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing through the streets and over the bridge.  A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling.  The whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once, as I went up the steps.  Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once.  And then I seemed sinking into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men, and then everything seemed passing away from me.  My soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.  I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a sort of agonizing feeling, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body.  I saw you
do it before I felt you." Then she began to laugh.  It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I listened to her breathlessly.  I did not quite like it, and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to another subject, and Lucy was like her old self again.  When we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more rosy.  Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very happy evening together.
19 August.--Joy, joy, joy!  Although not all joy.  At last, news of Jonathan.  The dear fellow has been ill, that is why he did not write. I am not afraid to think it or to say it, now that I know.  Mr. Hawkins sent me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh so kindly.  I am to leave in the morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary, and to bring him home.  Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there.  I have cried over the good Sister's letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies.  It is of Jonathan, and must be near my heart, for he is in my heart.  My journey is all mapped out, and my luggage ready.  I am only taking one change of dress.  Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for it, for it may be that . . .  I must write no more.  I must keep it to say to Jonathan, my husband.  The letter that he has seen and touched must comfort me till we meet.
LETTER, SISTER AGATHA, HOSPITAL OF ST. JOSEPH AND STE. MARY BUDA-PESTH, TO MISS WILLHELMINA MURRAY 12 August, "Dear Madam. "I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strong enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary.  He has been under our care for nearly six weeks, suffering from a violent brain fever.  He wishes me to convey his love, and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins, Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry for his delay, and that all of his work is completed.  He will require some few weeks' rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return.  He wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that he would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall not be wanting for help. "Believe me, "Yours, with sympathy and all blessings. Sister Agatha "P.S.--My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something more.  He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be his wife.  All blessings to you both!  He has had some fearful shock, so says our doctor, and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful, of wolves and poison and blood, of ghosts and
demons, and I fear to say of what.  Be careful of him always that there may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time to come.  The traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we knew nothing of his friends, and there was nothing on him, nothing that anyone could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard was told by the station master there that he rushed into the station shouting for a ticket for home.  Seeing from his violent demeanour that he was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the way thither that the train reached. "Be assured that he is well cared for.  He has won all hearts by his sweetness and gentleness.  He is truly getting on well, and I have no doubt will in a few weeks be all himself.  But be careful of him for safety's sake.  There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many, many, happy years for you both."
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 19 August.--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night.  About eight o'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting.  The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest in him, encouraged him to talk.  He is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile, but tonight, the man tells me, he was quite haughty.  Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he would say was, "I don't want to talk to you.  You don't count now.  The master is at hand." The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him.  If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous.  The combination is a dreadful one. At nine o'clock I visited him myself.  His attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant.  In his sublime self-feeling the difference between myself and the attendant seemed to him as nothing.  It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being.  How these madmen give themselves away!  The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall.  But the God created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow.  Oh, if men only knew! For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree.  I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict observation all the same.  All at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well.  He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-luster eyes. I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed
to excite his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily, "Bother them all!  I don't care a pin about them." "What?" I said.  "You don't mean to tell me you don't care about spiders?"  (Spiders at present are his hobby and the notebook is filling up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically, "The Bride maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride.  But when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled." He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed all the time I remained with him. I am weary tonight and low in spirits.  I cannot but think of Lucy, and how different things might have been.  If I don't sleep at once, chloral, the modern Morpheus!  I must be careful not to let it grow into a habit.  No, I shall take none tonight!  I have thought of Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two.  If need be, tonight shall be sleepless.
Later.--Glad I made the resolution, gladder that I kept to it.  I had lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the night watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield had escaped.  I threw on my clothes and ran down at once.  My patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about.  Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.  He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he had looked through the observation trap in the door.  His attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out.  He ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once sent up for me.  He was only in his night gear, and cannot be far off. The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door.  He is a bulky man, and couldn't get through the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost, and as we were only a few feet above ground landed unhurt. The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could.  As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house. I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend might be dangerous.  I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the other side.  I could see Renfield's figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him.  On the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old iron-bound oak door of the chapel.
He was talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping is upon him!  After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to him, the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in.  I heard him say . . . "I am here to do your bidding, Master.  I am your slave, and you will reward me, for I shall be faithful.  I have worshipped you long and afar off.  Now that you are near, I await your commands, and you will not pass me by, will you, dear Master, in your distribution of good things?" He is a selfish old beggar anyhow.  He thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes his is in a real Presence.  His manias make a startling combination.  When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.  He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before, and I hope I shall not again.  It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time.  With strength and determination like his, he might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now, at any rate.  Jack Sheppard himself couldn't get free from the strait waistcoat that keeps him restrained, and he's chained to the wall in the padded room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement. Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time.  "I shall be patient, Master.  It is coming, coming, coming!" So I took the hint, and came too.  I was too excited to sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep tonight.
CHAPTER 9
LETTER, MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA
Buda-Pesth, 24 August. "My dearest Lucy, "I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we parted at the railway station at Whitby. "Well, my dear, I got to Hull all right, and caught the boat to
Hamburg, and then the train on here.  I feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I knew I was coming to Jonathan, and that as I should have to do some nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.  I found my dear one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has vanished.  He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past.  At least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. "He has had some terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it.  Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse, tells me that he wanted her to tell me what they were, but she would only cross herself, and say she would never tell.  That the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them, she should respect her trust. "She is a sweet, good soul, and the next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject my poor dear raved about, added, 'I can tell you this much, my dear.  That it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself, and you, as his wife to be, have no cause to be concerned.  He has not forgotten you or what he owes to you.  His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can treat of.' "I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl.  The idea of my being jealous about Jonathan!  And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through me when I knew that no other woman was a cause for trouble.  I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his face while he sleeps.  He is waking! "When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something from the pocket.  I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.  I saw amongst them was his notebook, and was was going to ask him to let me look at it, for I knew that I might find some clue to his trouble, but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment. "Then he called me back, and he said to me very solemnly, 'Wilhelmina', I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him, 'You know, dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife.  There should be no secret, no concealment.  I have had a great shock, and when I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it was real of the dreaming of a madman.  You know I had brain fever, and that is to be mad.  The secret is here, and I do not want to know it.  I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.'  For, my dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete.  'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance?  Here is the book.  Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me know unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.'  He fell back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him.  I have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this afternoon, and am
waiting her reply . . ."
"She has come and told me that the Chaplain of the English mission church has been sent for.  We are to be married in an hour, or as soon after as Jonathan awakes." "Lucy, the time has come and gone.  I feel very solemn, but very, very happy.  Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he sat up in bed, propped up with pillows.  He answered his 'I will' firmly and strong.  I could hardly speak.  My heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me. "The dear sisters were so kind.  Please, God, I shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities I have taken upon me.  I must tell you of my wedding present.  When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words 'my husband'--left me alone with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring.  Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other, that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took his wife's hand, and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go through all the past again to win it, if need be.  The poor dear meant to have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the year. "Well, my dear, what could I say?  I could only tell him that I was the happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life.  And, my dear, when he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a solemn pledge between us. "Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?  It is not only because it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to me.  It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now, and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me, so that in your own married life you too may be all happy, as I am.  My dear, please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises, a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust.  I must not wish you no pain, for that can never be, but I do hope you will be always as happy as I am now.  Goodbye, my dear.  I shall post this at once, and perhaps, write you very soon again.  I must stop, for Jonathan is waking.  I must attend my husband! "Your ever-loving Mina Harker."
LETTER, LUCY WESTENRA TO MINA HARKER. Whitby, 30 August. "My dearest Mina, "Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own home with your husband.  I wish you were coming home soon enough to stay with us here.  The strong air would soon restore Jonathan. It has quite restored me.  I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of life, and sleep well.  You will be glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep.  I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a week, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am getting fat.  By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here.  We have such walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing together, and I love him more than ever.  He tells me that he loves me more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn't love me more than he did then. But this is nonsense.  There he is, calling to me.  So no more just at present from your loving, "Lucy. "P.S.--Mother sends her love.  She seems better, poor dear. "P.P.S.--We are to be married on 28 September."
DR. SEWARDS DIARY 20 August.--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting.  He has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.  For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent.  Then one night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself.  "Now I can wait.  Now I can wait." The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him.  He was still in the strait waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading.  I might almost say, cringing, softness.  I was satisfied with his present condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking furtively at them, "They think I could hurt you!  Fancy me hurting you!  The fools!" It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself disassociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others, but all the same I do not follow his thought.  Am I to take it that I have anything in common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together.  Or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well being is needful to Him?  I must find out later on.  Tonight he will not speak. Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt
him. He will only say, "I don't take any stock in cats.  I have more to think of now, and I can wait.  I can wait." After a while I left him.  The attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.
. . . Three nights has the same thing happened, violent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise.  I wish I could get some clue to the cause.  It would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.  Happy thought!  We shall tonight play sane wits against mad ones.  He escaped before without our help.  Tonight he shall escape with it.  We shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they are required.
23 August.--"The expected always happens."  How well Disraeli knew life.  Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our subtle arrangements were for nought.  At any rate, we have proved one thing, that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time.  We shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day.  I have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room, when once he is quiet, until the hour before sunrise.  The poor soul's body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it.  Hark!  The unexpected again!  I am called.  The patient has once more escaped.
Later.--Another night adventure.  Renfield artfully waited until the attendant was entering the room to inspect.  Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage.  I sent word for the attendants to follow.  Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he would have tried to kill me.  As we were holding him a strange thing happened.  He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew calm.  I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing.  Then I caught the patient's eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlight sky, except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west.  Bats usually wheel about, but this one seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said, "You needn't tie me.  I shall go quietly!"  Without trouble, we came back to the house.  I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall not forget this night.
LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY Hillingham, 24 August.--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things down.  Then we can have long talks when we do meet.  I wonder when it
will be.  I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy.  Last night I seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby.  Perhaps it is the change of air, or getting home again.  It is all dark and horrid to me, for I can remember nothing.  But I am full of vague fear, and I feel so weak and worn out.  When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me, and I hadn't the spirit to try to be cheerful.  I wonder if I could sleep in mother's room tonight.  I shall make an excuse to try.
25 August.--Another bad night.  Mother did not seem to take to my proposal.  She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to worry me.  I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while, but when the clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling asleep.  There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must have fallen asleep.  More bad dreams.  I wish I could remember them.  This morning I am horribly weak.  My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains me.  It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don't seem to be getting air enough.  I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I know he will be miserable to see me so.
LETTER, ARTHUR TO DR. SEWARD "Albemarle Hotel, 31 August "My dear Jack, "I want you to do me a favour.  Lucy is ill, that is she has no special disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day.  I have asked her if there is any cause, I not dare to ask her mother, for to disturb the poor lady's mind about her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal.  Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is spoken, disease of the heart, though poor Lucy does not know it yet.  I am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl's mind.  I am almost distracted when I think of her.  To look at her gives me a pang.  I told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at first, I know why, old fellow, she finally consented.  It will be a painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for her sake, and I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act.  You are to come to lunch at Hillingham tomorrow, two o'clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being alone with you.  I am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I can after you have seen her.  Do not fail! "Arthur."
TELEGRAM, ARTHUR HOLMWOOD TO SEWARD 1 September "Am summoned to see my father, who is worse.  Am writing.  Write me fully by tonight's post to Ring.  Wire me if necessary."
LETTER FROM DR. SEWARD TO ARTHUR HOLMWOOD 2 September "My dear old fellow, "With regard to Miss Westenra's health I hasten to let you know at once that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady that I know of.  At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with her appearance. She is woefully different from what she was when I saw her last.  Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full opportunity of examination such as I should wish. Our very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can bridge over.  I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to draw, in a measure, your own conclusions.  I shall then say what I have done and propose doing. "I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits.  Her mother was present, and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious.  I have no doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is. "We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us.  Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me.  We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained, for the servants were coming and going. "As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand.  When I saw that her high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis. "She said to me very sweetly, 'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.'  I reminded her that a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously anxious about her.  She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that matter in a word. 'Tell Arthur everything you choose.  I do not care for myself, but for him!'  So I am quite free. "I could easily see that she was somewhat bloodless, but I could not see the usual anemic signs, and by the chance, I was able to test the actual quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass.  It was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. "The qualitative analysis give a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in itself a vigorous state of health.  In other physical matters I was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety, but as there must be a cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental.
"She complains of difficulty breathing satisfactorily at times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but regarding which she can remember nothing.  She says that as a child, she used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back, and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where Miss Murray found her.  But she assures me that of late the habit has not returned. "I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of. I have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world.  I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to Miss Westenra.  This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for her. "Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal reason, so no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his wishes.  He is a seemingly arbitrary man, this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else.  He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day, and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind.  This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, and indomitable resolution, self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats, these form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind, work both in theory and practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy.  I tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in him.  I have asked him to come at once.  I shall see Miss Westenra tomorrow again.  She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call. "Yours always." John Seward
LETTER, ABRAHAM VAN HELSING, MD, DPh, D. Lit, ETC, ETC, TO DR. SEWARD 2 September. "My good Friend, "When I received your letter I am already coming to you.  By good fortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have trusted me.  Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who have trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear.  Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do.  But it is pleasure added to do for him, your friend, it is to you that I come.  Have near at hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too late on tomorrow, for it is
likely that I may have to return here that night.  But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longer if it must.  Till then goodbye, my friend John. "Van Helsing."
LETTER, DR. SEWARD TO HON. ARTHUR HOLMWOOD 3 September "My dear Art, "Van Helsing has come and gone.  He came on with me to Hillingham, and found that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that we were alone with her. "Van Helsing made a very careful examination of the patient.  He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of course I was not present all the time.  He is, I fear, much concerned, but says he must think.  When I told him of our friendship and how you trust to me in the matter, he said, 'You must tell him all you think.  Tell him him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will.  Nay, I am not jesting.  This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.'  I asked what he meant by that, for he was very serious.  This was when we had come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to Amsterdam.  He would not give me any further clue.  You must not be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good.  He will speak plainly enough when the time comes, be sure.  So I told him I would simply write an account of our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for THE DAILY TELEGRAPH.  He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the smuts of London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here.  I am to get his report tomorrow if he can possibly make it.  In any case I am to have a letter. "Well, as to the visit, Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first saw her, and certainly looked better.  She had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was very sweet to the Professor (as she always is), and tried to make him feel at ease, though I could see the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it. "I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick look under his bushy brows that I knew of old.  Then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that I could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge into reality.  Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation gently round to his visit, and suavely said, "'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved.  That is much, my dear, even were there that which I do not see.  They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a ghastly pale.  To them I say "Pouf!"'  And he snapped his fingers at me and went on.  'But you and I shall show them how
wrong they are.  How can he,' and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which he pointed me out in his class, on, or rather after, a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of, 'know anything of a young ladies?  He has his madmen to play with, and to bring them back to happiness, and to those that love them.  It is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards in that we can bestow such happiness.  But the young ladies!  He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them.  So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the professor came to the window and called me in.  He looked grave, but said, 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost, it has been but is not.  But the conditions of her are in no way anemic.  I have asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two questions, that so I may not chance to miss nothing.  I know well what she will say.  And yet there is cause.  There is always cause for everything.  I must go back home and think.  You must send me the telegram every day, and if there be cause I shall come again. The disease, for not to be well is a disease, interest me, and the sweet, young dear, she interest me too.  She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.' "As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.  And so now, Art, you know all I know.  I shall keep stern watch.  I trust your poor father is rallying.  It must be a terrible thing to you, my dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so dear to you.  I know your idea of duty to your father, and you are right to stick to it.  But if need be, I shall send you word to come at once to Lucy, so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from me."
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 4 September.--Zoophagous patient still keeps up our interest in him. He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless.  The attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid.  Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five minutes, however, he began to get more quiet, and finally sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now.  The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling.  I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some distance away.  It is now after the dinner hour of the asylum, and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly.  I cannot quite understand it.
Later.--Another change in my patient.  At five o'clock I looked in on
him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture by making nailmarks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding.  When he saw me, he came over and apologized for his bad conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to his own room, and to have his notebook again.  I thought it well to humour him, so he is back in his room with the window open.  He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the window sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies.  He is not now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider.  I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me, but he would not rise.  For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of far away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me. "All over!  All over!  He has deserted me.  No hope for me now unless I do it myself!"  Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said, "Doctor, won't you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar?  I think it would be very good for me." "And the flies?" I said. "Yes!  The flies like it, too, and I like the flies, therefore I like it."  And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue.  I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man as, I suppose, any in the world.  I wish I could fathom his mind.
Midnight.--Another change in him.  I had been to see Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling.  As his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in the morning.  It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water, and to realize all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart to endure it all.  I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from his window saw the red disc sink.  As it sank he became less and less frenzied, and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, on the floor.  It is wonderful, however, what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him.  I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do.  He went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar.  Then he took his fly box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box.  Then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed.  All this surprised me, so I asked him, "Are you going to keep flies any more?" "No," said he.  "I am sick of all that rubbish!"  He certainly is a wonderfully interesting study.  I wish I could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion.  Stop.  There may be a clue after all, if we can find why today his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset.  Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures, as at times the moon does others?  We shall see.

CHAPTER 10
LETTER, DR. SEWARD TO HON.  ARTHUR HOLMWOOD
6 September "My dear Art, "My news today is not so good.  Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.  There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it. Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me professionally about her.  I took advantage of the opportunity, and told her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with myself.  So now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy's weak condition, might be disastrous to her.  We are hedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor fellow, but, please God, we shall come through them all right.  If any need I shall write, so that, if you do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for news, In haste, "Yours ever," John Seward
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 7 September.--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at
Liverpool Street was, "Have you said anything to our young friend, to lover of her?" "No," I said.  "I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram.  I wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be." "Right, my friend," he said.  "Quite right!  Better he not know as yet.  Perhaps he will never know.  I pray so, but if it be needed, then he shall know all.  And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal with the madmen.  All men are mad in some way or the other, and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen too, the rest of the world.  You tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it.  You tell them not what you think.  So you shall keep knowledge in its place, where it may rest, where it may gather its kind around it and breed.  You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here."  He touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself the same way.  "I have for myself thoughts at the present.  Later I shall unfold to you." "Why not now?" I asked.  "It may do some good.  We may arrive at some decision."  He looked at me and said, "My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has ripened, while the milk of its mother earth is in him, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you, 'Look!  He's good corn, he will make a good crop when the time comes.'" I did not see the application and told him so.  For reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said, "The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then.  But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow.  That is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work of their life.  See you now, friend John?  I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout, if he sprout at all, there's some promise, and I wait till the ear begins to swell."  He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood.  Then he went on gravely, "You were always a careful student, and your case book was ever more full than the rest.  And I trust that good habit have not fail.  Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.  Even if you have not kept the good practice, let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may be, mind, I say may be, of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your people say. Take then good note of it.  Nothing is too small.  I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.  Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess.  We learn from failure, not from success!" When I described Lucy's symptoms, the same as before, but infinitely more marked, he looked very grave, but said nothing.  He took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs, "the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade," as he once called, in one of his lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us.  She was alarmed, but not
nearly so much as I expected to find her.  Nature in one of her beneficient moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors.  Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal, even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached, do not seem to reach her.  It is something like the way dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact.  If this be an ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of. I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and set down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy, or think of her illness more than was absolutely required.  She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life.  Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy's room.  If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her today. She was ghastly, chalkily pale.  The red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently. Her breathing was painful to see or hear.  Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose.  Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent.  Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room.  The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which was open.  Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door. "My god!" he said.  "This is dreadful.  There is not time to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's action as it should be.  There must be a transfusion of blood at once.  Is it you or me?" "I am younger and stronger, Professor.  It must be me." "Then get ready at once.  I will bring up my bag.  I am prepared." I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at the hall door.  When we reached the hall, the maid had just opened the door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in.  He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper, "Jack, I was so anxious.  I read between the lines of your letter, and have been in an agony.  The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for myself.  Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing?  I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming." When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him, he had been angry at his interruption at such a time, but now, as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognized the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed.  Without a pause he said to him as he held out his hand, "Sir, you have come in time.  You are the lover of our dear miss.  She is bad, very, very bad.  Nay, my child, do not go like that."  For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting.  "You are to help her.  You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your best help."
"What can I do?" asked Arthur hoarsely.  "Tell me, and I shall do it. My life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for her." The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer. "My young sir, I do not ask so much as that, not the last!" "What shall I do?"  There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostrils quivered with intent.  Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. "Come!" he said.  "You are a man, and it is a man we want.  You are better than me, better than my friend John."  Arthur looked bewildered, and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way. "Young miss is bad, very bad.  She wants blood, and blood she must have or die.  My friend John and I have consulted, and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of blood, to transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him.  John was to give his blood, as he is the more young and strong than me."--Here Arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence.--"But now you are here, you are more good than us, old or young, who toil much in the world of thought.  Our nerves are not so calm and our blood so bright than yours!" Arthur turned to him and said, "If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would understand . . ."  He stopped with a sort of choke in his voice. "Good boy!" said Van Helsing.  "In the not-so-far-off you will be happy that you have done all for her you love.  Come now and be silent.  You shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go, and you must leave at my sign.  Say no word to Madame.  You know how it is with her.  There must be no shock, any knowledge of this would be one.  Come!" We all went up to Lucy's room.  Arthur by direction remained outside. Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing.  She was not asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort.  Her eyes spoke to us, that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight.  Then he mixed a narcotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily, "Now, little miss, here is your medicine.  Drink it off, like a good child.  See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy.  Yes."  She had made the effort with success. It astonished me how long the drug took to act.  This, in fact, marked the extent of her weakness.  The time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids.  At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest its potency, and she fell into a deep sleep.  When the Professor was satisfied, he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his coat.  Then he added, "You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring over the table.  Friend John, help to me!"  So neither of us looked whilst he bent over her.
Van Helsing, turning to me, said, "He is so young and strong, and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it." Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the operation.  As the transfusion went on, something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine.  After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he was.  It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her. But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand, and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur.  I could hear my own heart beat.  Presently, he said in a soft voice, "Do not stir an instant.  It is enough.  You attend him.  I will look to her." When all was over, I could see how much Arthur was weakened.  I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round, the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head, "The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently."  And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow to the patient's head.  As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's ways of betraying emotion.  He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying, "Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while.  He must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love.  He must not stay here.  Hold a moment!  I may take it, sir, that you are anxious of result.  Then bring it with you, that in all ways the operation is successful.  You have saved her life this time, and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is.  I shall tell her all when she is well.  She shall love you none the less for what you have done.  Goodbye." When Arthur had gone I went back to the room.  Lucy was sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger.  I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved.  By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.  The velvet band again covered the red mark.  I asked the Professor in a whisper, "What do you make of that mark on her throat?" "What do you make of it?" "I have not examined it yet," I answered, and then and there proceeded to loose the band.  Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome looking.  There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn looking, as if by some trituration.  It at once occurred to me that that this wound, or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood. But I abandoned the idea as soon as it formed, for such a thing could not be.  The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had
before the transfusion. "Well?" said Van Helsing. "Well," said I.  "I can make nothing of it." The Professor stood up.  "I must go back to Amsterdam tonight," he said "There are books and things there which I want.  You must remain here all night, and you must not let your sight pass from her." "Shall I have a nurse?" I asked. "We are the best nurses, you and I.  You keep watch all night.  See that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her.  You must not sleep all the night.  Later on we can sleep, you and I.  I shall be back as soon as possible.  And then we may begin." "May begin?" I said.  "What on earth do you mean?" "We shall see!" he answered, as he hurried out.  He came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with a warning finger held up, "Remember, she is your charge.  If you leave her, and harm befall, you shall not sleep easy hereafter!"
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--CONTINUED 8 September.--I sat up all night with Lucy.  The opiate worked itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally.  She looked a different being from what she had been before the operation.  Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone.  When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her, she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed strength and excellent spirits.  I was firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil.  When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully whenever I caught her eye.  After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off.  It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once. "You do not want to sleep?" "No.  I am afraid." "Afraid to go to sleep!  Why so?  It is the boon we all crave for." "Ah, not if you were like me, if sleep was to you a presage of horror!" "A presage of horror!  What on earth do you mean?" "I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  And that is what is so terrible.
All this weakness comes to me in sleep, until I dread the very thought." "But, my dear girl, you may sleep tonight.  I am here watching you, and I can promise that nothing will happen." "Ah, I can trust you!" she said. I seized the opportunity, and said, "I promise that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once." "You will?  Oh, will you really?  How good you are to me.  Then I will sleep!"  And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep. All night long I watched by her.  She never stirred, but slept on and on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep.  Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum.  There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind. In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about many things.  I sent a short wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result of the operation.  My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all day to clear off.  It was dark when I was able to inquire about my zoophagous patient.  The report was good.  He had been quite quiet for the past day and night.  A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham tonight, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning.
9 September.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to Hillingham.  For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion.  Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits.  When she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said, "No sitting up tonight for you.  You are worn out.  I am quite well again.  Indeed, I am, and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you." I would not argue the point, but went and had my supper.  Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning. "Now," she said.  "You must stay here.  I shall leave this door open and my door too.  You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon.  If I want anything I shall call out, and you can come to me at once." I could not but acquiesce, for I was dog tired, and could not have sat up had I tried.  So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she
should want anything, I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.
LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY 9 September.--I feel so happy tonight.  I have been so miserably weak, that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky.  Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me.  I seem to feel his presence warm about me.  I suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills.  I know where my thoughts are.  If only Arthur knew!  My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking.  Oh, the blissful rest of last night!  How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.  And tonight I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and within call.  Thank everybody for being so good to me.  Thank God!  Goodnight Arthur.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 10 September.--I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, and started awake all in a second.  That is one of the things that we learn in an asylum, at any rate. "And how is our patient?" "Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me," I answered. "Come, let us see," he said.  And together we went into the room. The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed. As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart.  As I passed over he moved back, and his exclamation of horror, "Gott in Himmel!" needed no enforcement from his agonized face.  He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his iron face was drawn and ashen white.  I felt my knees begin to tremble. There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly white and wan-looking than ever.  Even the lips were white, and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him, and he put it down again softly. "Quick!" he said.  "Bring the brandy." I flew to the dining room, and returned with the decanter.  He wetted
the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart.  He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonizing suspense said, "It is not too late.  It beats, though but feebly.  All our work is undone.  We must begin again.  There is no young Arthur here now.  I have to call on you yourself this time, friend John."  As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag, and producing the instruments of transfusion.  I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a moment's delay, we began the operation. After a time, it did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling, Van Helsing held up a warning finger.  "Do not stir," he said.  "But I fear that with growing strength she may wake, and that would make danger, oh, so much danger.  But I shall precaution take.  I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia."  He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep.  It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips.  No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own lifeblood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves. The Professor watched me critically.  "That will do," he said. "Already?" I remonstrated.  "You took a great deal more from Art."  To which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied, "He is her lover, her fiance.  You have work, much work to do for her and for others, and the present will suffice." When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision.  I laid down, while I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick.  By and by he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself.  As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered. "Mind, nothing must be said of this.  If our young lover should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to him.  It would at once frighten him and enjealous him, too.  There must be none.  So!" When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said, "You are not much the worse.  Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and rest awhile, then have much breakfast and come here to me." I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were.  I had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength.  I felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred.  I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign any where to show for it.  I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges, tiny though they were.
Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before.  When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment.  I could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office. Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened.  I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to me gratefully, "We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself.  You are looking pale yourself.  You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit, that you do!"  As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long an unwonted drain to the head.  The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me.  I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my lips.  With a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows. Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me: "Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough.  Make yourself strong.  I stay here tonight, and I shall sit up with little miss myself.  You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know.  I have grave reasons.  No, do not ask me.  Think what you will. Do not fear to think even the most not-improbable.  Goodnight." In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy.  They implored me to let them, and when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the 'foreign gentleman'.  I was much touched by their kindness.  Perhaps it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, that their devotion was manifested.  For over and over again have I seen similar instances of woman's kindness.  I got back here in time for a late dinner, went my rounds, all well, and set this down whilst waiting for sleep.  It is coming.
11 September.--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham.  Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better.  Shortly after I had arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor.  He opened it with much impressment, assumed, of course, and showed a great bundle of white flowers. "These are for you, Miss Lucy," he said. "For me?  Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!" "Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with.  These are medicines." Here Lucy made a wry face.  "Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but you do not know how.  I put him in your window,
I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so you sleep well. Oh, yes!  They, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late." Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them.  Now she threw them down saying, with half laughter, and half disgust, "Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me.  Why, these flowers are only common garlic." To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting, "No trifling with me!  I never jest!  There is grim purpose in what I do, and I warn you that you do not thwart me.  Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own."  Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went on more gently, "Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me.  I only do for your good, but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers.  See, I place them myself in your room.  I make myself the wreath that you are to wear.  But hush!  No telling to others that make so inquisitive questions.  We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience, and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you.  Now sit still a while.  Come with me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass houses all the year.  I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here." We went into the room, taking the flowers with us.  The Professor's actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopeia that I ever heard of.  First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely.  Next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell.  Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way.  It all seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said, "Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit." "Perhaps I am!" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck. We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck.  The last words he said to her were, "Take care you do not disturb it, and even if the room feel close, do not tonight open the window or the door." "I promise," said Lucy.  "And thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me!  Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends?"
As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said, "Tonight I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want, two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink.  Tomorrow in the morning early you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong for my 'spell' which I have work.  Ho, ho!" He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.
CHAPTER 11
LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY 12 September.--How good they all are to me.  I quite love that dear Dr. Van Helsing.  I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He positively frightened me, he was so fierce.  And yet he must have been right, for I feel comfort from them already.  Somehow, I do not dread being alone tonight, and I can go to sleep without fear.  I shall not mind any flapping outside the window.  Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late, the pain of sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, and with such unknown horrors as it has for me!  How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads, to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.  Well, here I am tonight, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with 'virgin crants and maiden strewments.'  I never liked garlic before, but tonight it is delightful!  There is peace in its smell.  I feel sleep coming already.  Goodnight, everybody.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 13 September.--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual, up to time.  The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting.  The Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now. Let all be put down exactly.  Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight o'clock.  It was a lovely morning.  The bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature's annual work.  The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the trees.  When we entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room.  She is always an early riser.  She greeted us warmly and said, "You will be glad to know that Lucy is better.  The dear child is still asleep.  I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I should disturb her."  The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant.  He rubbed his hands together, and said, "Aha!  I thought I had diagnosed the case.  My treatment is working."
To which she replied, "You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor.  Lucy's state this morning is due in part to me." "How do you mean, ma'am?" asked the Professor. "Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into her room.  She was sleeping soundly, so soundly that even my coming did not wake her.  But the room was awfully stuffy.  There were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck.  I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air.  You will be pleased with her, I am sure." She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As she had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen gray.  He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be.  He actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room.  But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining room and closed the door. Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down.  He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless way.  Finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe.  "God!  God!  God!" he said.  "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset?  Is there fate amongst us still, send down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?  This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul, and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die, then both die.  Oh, how we are beset!  How are all the powers of the devils against us!" Suddenly he jumped to his feet.  "Come," he said, "come, we must see and act.  Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not. We must fight him all the same."  He went to the hall door for his bag, and together we went up to Lucy's room. Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.  This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful, waxen pallor as before.  He wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity. "As I expected," he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much.  Without a word he went and locked the door, and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood.  I had long ago recognized the necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a warning hand.  "No!" he said.  "Today you must operate.  I shall provide.  You are weakened already."  As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirtsleeve.
Again the operation.  Again the narcotic.  Again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep.  This time I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested. Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must not remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him. That the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure.  Then he took over the care of the case himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next, and would send me word when to come. After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal. What does it all mean?  I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.
LUCY WESTENRA'S DIARY 17 September.--Four days and nights of peace.  I am getting so strong again that I hardly know myself.  It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me.  I have a dim half remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing, darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant.  And then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water.  Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away.  The noises that used to frighten me out of my wits, the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know not what, have all ceased.  I go to bed now without any fear of sleep.  I do not even try to keep awake.  I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem.  Tonight Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam.  But I need not be watched.  I am well enough to be left alone. Thank God for Mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for all our friends who have been so kind!  I shall not even feel the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time.  I found him asleep twice when I awoke.  But I did not fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something flapped almost angrily against the window panes.
THE PALL MALL GAZETTE 18 September. THE ESCAPED WOLF PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER INTERVIEW WITH THE KEEPER IN THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using the words 'PALL MALL GAZETTE' as a sort of talisman, I managed
to find the keeper of the section of the Zoological Gardens in which the wolf department is included.  Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant house, and was just sitting down to his tea when I found him.  Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk, elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty comfortable.  The keeper would not enter on what he called business until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied.  Then when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said, "Now, Sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want.  You'll excoose me refoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjucts afore meals.  I gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore I begins to arsk them questions." "How do you mean, ask them questions?" I queried, wishful to get him into a talkative humor. "'Ittin' of them over the 'ead with a pole is one way.  Scratchin' of their ears in another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a showorf to their gals.  I don't so much mind the fust, the 'ittin of the pole part afore I chucks in their dinner, but I waits till they've 'ad their sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the ear scratchin'.  Mind you," he added philosophically, "there's a deal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here's you a-comin' and arskin' of me questions about my business, and I that grump-like that only for your bloomin' 'arf-quid I'd 'a' seen you blowed fust 'fore I'd answer.  Not even when you arsked me sarcastic like if I'd like you to arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions.  Without offence did I tell yer to go to 'ell?" "You did." "An' when you said you'd report me for usin' obscene language that was 'ittin' me over the 'ead.  But the 'arf-quid made that all right.  I weren't a-goin' to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my 'owl as the wolves and lions and tigers does.  But, lor' love yer 'art, now that the old 'ooman has stuck a chunk of her teacake in me, an' rinsed me out with her bloomin' old teapot, and I've lit hup, you may scratch my ears for all you're worth, and won't even get a growl out of me.  Drive along with your questions.  I know what yer a-comin' at, that 'ere escaped wolf." "Exactly.  I want you to give me your view of it.  Just tell me how it happened, and when I know the facts I'll get you to say what you consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will end." "All right, guv'nor.  This 'ere is about the 'ole story. That 'ere wolf what we called Bersicker was one of three gray ones that came from Norway to Jamrach's, which we bought off him four years ago.  He was a nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of.  I'm more surprised at 'im for wantin' to get out nor any other animile in the place.  But, there, you can't trust wolves no more nor women." "Don't you mind him, Sir!" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery
laugh.  "'E's got mindin' the animiles so long that blest if he ain't like a old wolf 'isself!  But there ain't no 'arm in 'im." "Well, Sir, it was about two hours after feedin' yesterday when I first hear my disturbance.  I was makin' up a litter in the monkey house for a young puma which is ill.  But when I heard the yelpin' and 'owlin' I kem away straight.  There was Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out.  There wasn't much people about that day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a 'ook nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin' through it.  He had a 'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him, for it seemed as if it was 'im as they was hirritated at.  He 'ad white kid gloves on 'is 'ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says, 'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.' "'Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give 'isself.  He didn't get angry, as I 'oped he would, but he smiled a kind of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth.  'Oh no, they wouldn't like me,' 'e says. "'Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin' of him.  'They always like a bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea time, which you 'as a bagful.' "Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin' they lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever.  That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn't put in his hand and stroke the old wolf's ears too! "'Tyke care,' says I. 'Bersicker is quick.' "'Never mind,' he says.  I'm used to 'em!' "'Are you in the business yourself?' I says, tyking off my 'at, for a man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers. "'Nom,' says he, 'not exactly in the business, but I 'ave made pets of several.'  And with that he lifts his 'at as perlite as a lord, and walks away.  Old Bersicker kep' a-lookin' arter 'im till 'e was out of sight, and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the 'ole hevening.  Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves here all began a-'owling.  There warn't nothing for them to 'owl at.  There warn't no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin' a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road.  Once or twice I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the 'owling stopped.  Just before twelve o'clock I just took a look round afore turnin' in, an', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker's cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty.  And that's all I know for certing." "Did any one else see anything?" "One of our gard'ners was a-comin' 'ome about that time from a
'armony, when he sees a big gray dog comin' out through the garding 'edges.  At least, so he says, but I don't give much for it myself, for if he did 'e never said a word about it to his missis when 'e got 'ome, and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all night a-huntin' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein' anything.  My own belief was that the 'armony 'ad got into his 'ead." "Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf?" "Well, Sir," he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, "I think I can, but I don't know as 'ow you'd be satisfied with the theory." "Certainly I shall.  If a man like you, who knows the animals from experience, can't hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?" "Well then, Sir, I accounts for it this way.  It seems to me that 'ere wolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out." From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I could see that it had done service before, and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell.  I couldn't cope in badinage with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart, so I said, "Now, Mr. Bilder, we'll consider that first half-sovereign worked off, and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've told me what you think will happen." "Right y'are, Sir," he said briskly.  "Ye'll excoose me, I know, for a-chaffin' of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much as telling me to go on." "Well, I never!" said the old lady. "My opinion is this: that 'ere wolf is a'idin' of, somewheres.  The gard'ner wot didn't remember said he was a-gallopin' northward faster than a horse could go, but I don't believe him, for, yer see, Sir, wolves don't gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein' built that way.  Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets in packs and does be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is.  But, Lor' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so clever or bold as a good dog, and not half a quarter so much fight in 'im.  This one ain't been used to fightin' or even to providin' for hisself, and more like he's somewhere round the Park a'hidin' an' a'shiverin' of, and if he thinks at all, wonderin' where he is to get his breakfast from.  Or maybe he's got down some area and is in a coal cellar.  My eye, won't some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes a-shinin' at her out of the dark!  If he can't get food he's bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher's shop in time.  If he doesn't, and some nursemaid goes out walkin' or orf with a soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then I shouldn't be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That's all." I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up
against the window, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural length with surprise. "God bless me!" he said.  "If there ain't old Bersicker come back by 'isself!" He went to the door and opened it, a most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me.  I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us.  A personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea. After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal itself was a peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all picture-wolves, Red Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving her confidence in masquerade. The whole scene was a unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos.  The wicked wolf that for a half a day had paralyzed London and set all the children in town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son.  Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said, "There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble.  Didn't I say it all along?  Here's his head all cut and full of broken glass.  'E's been a-gettin' over some bloomin' wall or other.  It's a shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.  This 'ere's what comes of it.  Come along, Bersicker." He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the fatted calf, and went off to report. I came off too, to report the only exclusive information that is given today regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 17 September.--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy, had fallen sadly into arrear.  Suddenly the door was burst open, and in rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion.  I was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant's notice he made straight at me.  He had a dinner knife in his hand, and as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us.  He was too quick and too strong for me, however, for before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.
Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right hand and he was sprawling on his back on the floor.  My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet.  I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time.  When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment positively sickened me.  He was lying on his belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist.  He was easily secured, and to my surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again, "The blood is the life!  The blood is the life!" I cannot afford to lose blood just at present.  I have lost too much of late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy's illness and its horrible phases is telling on me.  I am over excited and weary, and I need rest, rest, rest.  Happily Van Helsing has not summoned me, so I need not forego my sleep.  Tonight I could not well do without it.
TELEGRAM, VAN HELSING, ANTWERP, TO SEWARD, CARFAX (Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given, delivered late by twenty-two hours.) 17 September.--Do not fail to be at Hilllingham tonight. If not watching all the time, frequently visit and see that flowers are as placed, very important, do not fail.  Shall be with you as soon as possible after arrival.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 18 September.--Just off train to London.  The arrival of Van Helsing's telegram filled me with dismay.  A whole night lost, and I know by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is possible that all may be well, but what may have happened?  Surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy's phonograph.
MEMORANDUM LEFT BY LUCY WESTENRA 17 September, Night.--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me.  This is an exact record of what took place tonight.  I feel I am dying of weakness, and have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the doing. I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr. Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.
I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I know so well.  I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the next room, as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be, so that I might have called him.  I tried to sleep, but I could not.  Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake.  Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it.  So, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out, "Is there anybody there?"  There was no answer.  I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.  Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, but more fierce and deeper.  I went to the window and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window.  So I went back to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep.  Presently the door opened, and mother looked in.  Seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, she came in and sat by me.  She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont, "I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all right." I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me.  She did not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while and then go back to her own bed.  As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers the flapping and buffeting came to the window again.  She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out, "What is that?" I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet.  But I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly.  After a while there was the howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor. The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt gray wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her.  Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me.  For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat.  Then she fell over, as if struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round.  I kept my eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole myriad of little specks seems to come blowing in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert.  I tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear Mother's poor body, which seemed to grow cold already, for
her dear heart had ceased to beat, weighed me down, and I remembered no more for a while. The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered consciousness again.  Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling.  The dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling, and in our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing.  I was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door.  I called to them, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out.  The wind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to.  They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up.  They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the dining room and each have a glass of wine.  The door flew open for an instant and closed again.  The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the dining room, and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother's breast.  When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and besides, I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now.  I was surprised that the maids did not come back.  I called them, but got no answer, so I went to the dining room to look for them. My heart sank when I saw what had happened.  They all four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily.  The decanter of sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about.  I was suspicious, and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle which Mother's doctor uses for her--oh! did use--was empty.  What am I to do? What am I to do?  I am back in the room with Mother.  I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged.  Alone with the dead! I dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window. The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do?  God shield me from harm this night!  I shall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find it when they come to lay me out.  My dear mother gone!  It is time that I go too.  Goodbye, dear Arthur, if I should not survive this night.  God keep you, dear, and God help me!
CHAPTER 12
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 18 September.--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.
Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone.  I knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door.  After a while, finding no response, I knocked and rang again, still no answer.  I cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour, for it was now ten o'clock, and so rang and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me.  Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight round us?  Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late?  I know that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses, and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry anywhere. I could find no means of ingress.  Every window and door was fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch.  As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet.  They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.  When he saw me, he gasped out, "Then it was you, and just arrived.  How is she?  Are we too late?  Did you not get my telegram?" I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his telegram early in the morning, and had not a minute in coming here, and that I could not make any one in the house hear me.  He paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly, "Then I fear we are too late.  God's will be done!" With his usual recuperative energy, he went on, "Come.  If there be no way open to get in, we must make one.  Time is all in all to us now." We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window.  The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window.  I helped the Professor in, and followed him.  There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at hand.  We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant women lying on the floor.  There was no need to think them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away he said, "We can attend to them later."  Then we ascended to Lucy's room.  For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear.  With white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the room. How shall I describe what we saw?  On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her mother.  The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the drought through the broken window, showing the drawn, white, face, with a look of terror fixed upon it.  By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more drawn.  The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white
and mangled.  Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor Lucy's breast.  Then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me, "It is not yet too late!  Quick!  Quick!  Bring the brandy!" I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found on the table.  The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off.  I did not stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing.  He rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands.  He said to me, "I can do this, all that can be at the present.  You go wake those maids.  Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard.  Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath.  This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her.  She will need be heated before we can do anything more." I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women.  The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner.  I was stern with them, however, and would not let them talk.  I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and if they delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy.  So, sobbing and crying they went about their way, half clad as they were, and prepared fire and water.  Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water.  We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door.  One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it.  Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood.  I bade her simply tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now.  She went away with the message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him. I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly earnest.  I knew, as he knew, that it was a stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told him so.  He answered me in a way that I did not understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear. "If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon."  He went on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour. Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect.  Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement.  Van Helsing's face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me, "The first gain is ours! Check to the King!" We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat.  I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her
throat.  She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her. Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me out of the room. "We must consult as to what is to be done," he said as we descended the stairs.  In the hall he opened the dining room door, and we passed in, he closing the door carefully behind him.  The shutters had been opened, but the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes.  The room was, therefore, dimly dark.  It was, however, light enough for our purposes.  Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity.  He was evidently torturing his mind about something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke. "What are we to do now?  Where are we to turn for help?  We must have another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life won't be worth an hour's purchase.  You are exhausted already.  I am exhausted too.  I fear to trust those women, even if they would have courage to submit.  What are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her?" "What's the matter with me, anyhow?" The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as I cried out, "Quincey Morris!" and rushed towards him with outstretched hands. "What brought you here?" I cried as our hands met. "I guess Art is the cause." He handed me a telegram.--'Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.  Cannot leave.  Father still in same condition.  Send me word how Lucy is.  Do not delay.--Holmwood.' "I think I came just in the nick of time.  You know you have only to tell me what to do." Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in the eyes as he said, "A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble.  You're a man and no mistake.  Well, the devil may work against us for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them." Once again we went through that ghastly operation.  I have not the heart to go through with the details.  Lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions.  Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear.  However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van Helsing made a sub-cutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with good effect.  Her faint became a profound
slumber.  The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast.  Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where Lucy now was.  When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or two of note paper in his hand.  He had evidently read it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow.  There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.  He handed me the paper saying only, "It dropped from Lucy's breast when we carried her to the bath." When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause asked him, "In God's name, what does it all mean?  Was she, or is she, mad, or what sort of horrible danger is it?"  I was so bewildered that I did not know what to say more.  Van Helsing put out his hand and took the paper, saying, "Do not trouble about it now.  Forget it for the present.  You shall know and understand it all in good time, but it will be later.  And now what is it that you came to me to say?"  This brought me back to fact, and I was all myself again. "I came to speak about the certificate of death.  If we do not act properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have to be produced.  I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did.  I know, and you know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it.  Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker." "Good, oh my friend John!  Well thought of!  Truly Miss Lucy, if she be sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that love her.  One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old man.  Ah, yes, I know, friend John.  I am not blind!  I love you all the more for it!  Now go." In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him that Mrs. Westenra was dead, that Lucy also had been ill, but was now going on better, and that Van Helsing and I were with her.  I told him where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said, "When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to ourselves?"  I nodded in reply and went out.  I found no difficulty about the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements. When I got back Quincey was waiting for me.  I told him I would see him as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room.  She was still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side.  From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of fore-stalling nature.  So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms.
When we were alone, he said to me, "Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no right to be, but this is no ordinary case.  You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her, but although that's all past and gone, I can't help feeling anxious about her all the same.  What is it that's wrong with her?  The Dutchman, and a fine old fellow he is, I can see that, said that time you two came into the room, that you must have another transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.  Now I know well that you medical men speak in camera, and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private.  But this is no common matter, and whatever it is, I have done my part.  Is not that so?" "That's so," I said, and he went on. "I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did today.  Is not that so?" "That's so." "And I guess Art was in it too.  When I saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer.  I have not seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night.  One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay.  Jack, if you may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?" As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious.  He was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain.  His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him, and there was a royal lot of it, too, to keep him from breaking down.  I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret, but already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase. "That's so." "And how long has this been going on?" "About ten days." "Ten days!  Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood of four strong men.  Man alive, her whole body wouldn't hold it."  Then coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper.  "What took it out?" I shook my head.  "That," I said, "is the crux.  Van Helsing is simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits' end.  I can't even hazard a guess.  There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall not occur again.  Here we stay until all be well, or ill."
Quincey held out his hand.  "Count me in," he said.  "You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I'll do it." When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feel in her breast, and to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing had given me to read.  The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed.  Her eyes then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened.  Then she looked round the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered.  She gave a loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what was meant, that she had realized to the full her mother's death.  So we tried what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time.  We told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her.  Towards dusk she fell into a doze.  Here a very odd thing occurred.  Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two.  Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her.  All the same, however, she went on with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her hands. Finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments.  Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he said nothing.
19 September.--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it.  The Professor and I took in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment unattended.  Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house. When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy's strength.  She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good.  At times she slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between sleeping and waking.  Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more haggard, and her breathing was softer.  Her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which looked positively longer and sharper than usual.  When she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying one.  In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.  Quincey went off to meet him at the station. When he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks.  When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak.  In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened.  Arthur's presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant.  She rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived.  He too pulled himself together, and spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything. It is now nearly one o'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with
her.  I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering this on Lucy's phonograph.  Until six o'clock they are to try to rest. I fear that tomorrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too great.  The poor child cannot rally.  God help us all.
LETTER MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA (Unopened by her) 17 September My dearest Lucy, "It seems an age since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote.  You will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news.  Well, I got my husband back all right.  When we arrived at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins.  He took us to his house, where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together.  After dinner Mr. Hawkins said, "'My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity, and may every blessing attend you both.  I know you both from children, and have, with love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here with me.  I have left to me neither chick nor child.  All are gone, and in my will I have left you everything.'  I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands.  Our evening was a very, very happy one. "So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my bedroom and the drawing room I can see the great elms of the cathedral close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral, and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of rooks--and humans.  I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and housekeeping.  Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day, for now that Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients. "How is your dear mother getting on?  I wish I could run up to town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my shoulders, and Jonathan wants looking after still.  He is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the long illness.  Even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual placidity.  However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust.  And now I have told you my news, let me ask yours.  When are you to be married, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear, and is it to be a public or private
wedding?  Tell me all about it, dear, tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me.  Jonathan asks me to send his 'respectful duty', but I do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker.  And so, as you love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb, I send you simply his 'love' instead. Goodbye, my dearest Lucy, and blessings on you. "Yours, "Mina Harker"
REPORT FROM PATRICK HENNESSEY, MD, MRCSLK, QCPI, ETC, ETC, TO JOHN SEWARD, MD 20 September My dear Sir: "In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge.  With regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say.  He has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours, the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away.  The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. "I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house.  As he passed the window of Renfield's room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to.  The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to 'shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar', whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice, so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of place he had got to by saying, 'Lor' bless yer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse.  I pity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the house with a wild beast like that.' "Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him where the gate of the empty house was.  He went away followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man.  I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred.  I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner.  I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair.  It was, I am sorry to say,
however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again.  This time he had broken out through the window of his room, and was running down the avenue.  I called to the attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief.  My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden boxes.  The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise.  Before I could get up to him, the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head against the ground.  If I had not seized him just at the moment, I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt end of his heavy whip.  It was a horrible blow, but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no lightweight, and the others were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting, but as we began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait waistcoat on him, he began to shout, 'I'll frustrate them! They shan't rob me! They shan't murder me by inches!  I'll fight for my Lord and Master!' and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings.  It was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room.  One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken.  However, I set it all right, and he is going on well. "The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us.  Their threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman.  They said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him.  They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labors of any place of public entertainment.  I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of strong grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so 'bloomin' good a bloke' as your correspondent.  I took their names and addresses, in case they might be needed.  They are as follows:  Jack Smollet, of Dudding's Rents, King George's Road, Great Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley's Row, Guide Court, Bethnal Green. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and Shipment Company, Orange Master's Yard, Soho. "I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall wire you at once if there is anything of importance. "Believe me, dear Sir, "Yours faithfully, "Patrick Hennessey."
LETTER, MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA (Unopened by her) 18 September "My dearest Lucy, "Such a sad blow has befallen us.  Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.  Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father.  I never knew either father or mother, so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me. Jonathan is greatly distressed.  It is not only that he feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life, and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account.  He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous.  He begins to doubt himself.  I try to cheer him up, and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself.  But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most.  Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his, a nature which enabled him by our dear, good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years, should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone.  Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness, but Lucy dear, I must tell someone, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in.  I dread coming up to London, as we must do that day after tomorrow, for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father.  As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few minutes.  Forgive me for troubling you.  With all blessings, "Your loving "Mina Harker"
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 20 September.--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry tonight.  I am too miserable, too low spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death.  And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late, Lucy's mother and Arthur's father, and now . . . Let me get on with my work. I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy.  We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first.  It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go.
Van Helsing was very kind to him.  "Come, my child," he said.  "Come with me.  You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You must not be alone, for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.  Come to the drawing room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas.  You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep." Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn.  She lay quite still, and I looked around the room to see that all was as it should be.  I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic.  The whole of the window sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums.  Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning.  In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down beside her, and presently she moved uneasily.  At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled around, doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim, and every now and again struck the window with its wings.  When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat.  I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her. Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.  She took but a little, and that languidly.  There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness.  It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her.  It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her, but that when she waked she clutched them close, There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times. At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me.  Arthur had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on.  When he saw Lucy's face I could hear the hissing indraw of breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper.  "Draw up the blind.  I want light!"  Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully.  He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As he did so he started back and I could hear his ejaculation, "Mein Gott!" as it was smothered in his throat.  I bent over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.  The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.
For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face at its sternest.  Then he turned to me and said calmly, "She is dying.  It will not be long now.  It will be much difference, mark me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep.  Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the last.  He trusts us, and we have promised him." I went to the dining room and waked him.  He was dazed for a moment, but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear.  I assured him that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near.  He covered his face with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders shook with grief.  I took him by the hand and raised him up. "Come," I said, "my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude.  It will be best and easiest for her." When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Helsing had, with his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible.  He had even brushed Lucy's hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples.  When we came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly, "Arthur!  Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!" He was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. "No," he whispered, "not yet!  Hold her hand, it will comfort her more." So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes.  Then gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep.  For a little bit her breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child's. And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in the night.  Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever.  In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips, "Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!  Kiss me!" Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her, but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost across the room. "Not on your life!" he said, "not for your living soul and hers!"  And he stood between them like a lion at bay. Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say, and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realized the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting. I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face.  The sharp teeth clamped
together.  Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily. Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's great brown one, drawing it close to her, she kissed it.  "My true friend," she said, in a faint voice, but with untellable pathos, "My true friend, and his!  Oh, guard him, and give me peace!" "I swear it!" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his hand, as one who registers an oath.  Then he turned to Arthur, and said to him, "Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the forehead, and only once." Their eyes met instead of their lips, and so they parted.  Lucy's eyes closed, and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took Arthur's arm, and drew him away. And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it ceased. "It is all over," said Van Helsing.  "She is dead!" I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing room, where he sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see. I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and his face was sterner than ever.  Some change had come over her body.  Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines.  Even the lips had lost their deadly pallor.  It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be. "We thought her dying whilst she slept, And sleeping when she died."
I stood beside Van Helsing, and said, "Ah well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last.  It is the end!" He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity, "Not so, alas!  Not so.  It is only the beginning!" When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered, "We can do nothing as yet.  Wait and see."
CHAPTER 13
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--cont. The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and her mother might be buried together.  I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff was afflicted, or blessed, with something of his own obsequious suavity.
Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out from the death chamber, "She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir.  It's quite a privilege to attend on her.  It's not too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment!" I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away.  This was possible from the disordered state of things in the household.  There were no relatives at hand, and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his father's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden.  Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc.  He insisted upon looking over Lucy's papers himself.  I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me, "I know, I know.  You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor.  But this is not altogether for the law.  You knew that, when you avoided the coroner.  I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more, such as this." As he spoke he took from his pocket book the memorandum which had been in Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her sleep. "When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him tonight.  For me, I watch here in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself search for what may be.  It is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers." I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written to him.  All the poor lady's papers were in order.  Explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given.  I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room, saying, "Can I help you friend John?  I am free, and if I may, my service is to you." "Have you got what you looked for?" I asked. To which he replied, "I did not look for any specific thing.  I only hoped to find, and find I have, all that there was, only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun.  But I have them here, and we shall for the present say nothing of them.  I shall see that poor lad tomorrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some." When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me, "And now, friend John, I think we may to bed.  We want sleep, both you and I, and rest to recuperate.  Tomorrow we shall have much to do, but for the tonight there is no need of us.  Alas!" Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy.  The undertaker had certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small chapelle ardente.  There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,
and death was made as little repulsive as might be.  The end of the winding sheet was laid over the face.  When the Professor bent over and turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us. The tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well.  All Lucy's loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of 'decay's effacing fingers', had but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse. The Professor looked sternly grave.  He had not loved her as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes.  He said to me, "Remain till I return," and left the room.  He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed.  Then he took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth.  He restored the sheet to its place, and we came away. I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the door, he entered, and at once began to speak. "Tomorrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem knives." "Must we make an autopsy?" I asked. "Yes and no.  I want to operate, but not what you think.  Let me tell you now, but not a word to another.  I want to cut off her head and take out her heart.  Ah!  You a surgeon, and so shocked!  You, whom I have seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder.  Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that you loved her, and I have not forgotten it for is I that shall operate, and you must not help.  I would like to do it tonight, but for Arthur I must not.  He will be free after his father's funeral tomorrow, and he will want to see her, to see it. Then, when she is coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep.  We shall unscrew the coffin lid, and shall do our operation, and then replace all, so that none know, save we alone." "But why do it at all?  The girl is dead.  Why mutilate her poor body without need?  And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing to gain by it, no good to her, to us, to science, to human knowledge, why do it?  Without such it is monstrous." For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite tenderness, "Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart, and I love you the more because it does so bleed.  If I could, I would take on myself the burden that you do bear.  But there are things that you know not, but that you shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant things.  John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause?  I may err, I am but man, but I believe in all I do.  Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came?  Yes!  Were you not amazed, nay horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love, though she was dying, and snatched him away by all my strength?  Yes!  And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my
rough old hand and bless me?  Yes!  And did you not hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful?  Yes! "Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do.  You have for many years trust me.  You have believe me weeks past, when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt.  Believe me yet a little, friend John.  If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think, and that is not perhaps well.  And if I work, as work I shall, no matter trust or no trust, without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel oh so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!"  He paused a moment and went on solemnly, "Friend John, there are strange and terrible days before us.  Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to a good end.  Will you not have faith in me?" I took his hand, and promised him.  I held my door open as he went away, and watched him go to his room and close the door.  As I stood without moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage, she had her back to me, so did not see me, and go into the room where Lucy lay.  The sight touched me.  Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love.  Here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest. I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room.  He came over to my bedside and said, "You need not trouble about the knives.  We shall not do it." "Why not?" I asked.  For his solemnity of the night before had greatly impressed me. "Because," he said sternly, "it is too late, or too early.  See!" Here he held up the little golden crucifix. "This was stolen in the night." "How stolen," I asked in wonder, "since you have it now?" "Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the woman who robbed the dead and the living.  Her punishment will surely come, but not through me.  She knew not altogether what she did, and thus unknowing, she only stole.  Now we must wait."  He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a new puzzle to grapple with. The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came, Mr. Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale.  He was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all cares as to details.  During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs in absolute order.  He informed us that, with the exception of a certain entailed property of Lucy's father which now, in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate, real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood.  When he had told us so much he went on, "Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition,
and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance.  Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes.  Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept.  We were right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment. "Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes.  For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no will, and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case, have been treated at her decease as under intestacy.  In which case Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world.  And the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger.  I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced." He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part, in which he was officially interested, of so great a tragedy, was an object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding. He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and see Lord Godalming.  His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts.  Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so a little before that time we visited the death chamber.  It was so in very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it.  The undertaker, true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to, explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fiancee quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved. Poor fellow!  He looked desperately sad and broken.  Even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his much-tried emotions.  He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father, and to lose him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him.  With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he was sweetly courteous.  But I could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him.  The professor noticed it too, and motioned me to bring him upstairs.  I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and led me in, saying huskily, "You loved her too, old fellow.  She told me all about it, and there
was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you.  I don't know how to thank you for all you have done for her.  I can't think yet . . ." Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid his head on my breast, crying, "Oh, Jack!  Jack!  What shall I do?  The whole of life seems gone from me all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for." I comforted him as well as I could.  In such cases men do not need much expression.  A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's heart.  I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said softly to him, "Come and look at her." Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.  God!  How beautiful she was.  Every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness.  It frightened and amazed me somewhat.  And as for Arthur, he fell to trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague.  At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper, "Jack, is she really dead?" I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest, for I felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than I could help, that it often happened that after death faces become softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty, that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering.  I seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and long, he turned aside.  I told him that that must be goodbye, as the coffin had to be prepared, so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead.  He came away, fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came. I left him in the drawing room, and told Van Helsing that he had said goodbye, so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin.  When he came out of the room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he replied, "I am not surprised.  Just now I doubted for a moment myself!" We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make the best of things.  Van Helsing had been silent all dinner time, but when we had lit our cigars he said, "Lord . . ." but Arthur interrupted him. "No, no, not that, for God's sake!  Not yet at any rate.  Forgive me, sir.  I did not mean to speak offensively.  It is only because my loss is so recent." The Professor answered very sweetly, "I only used that name because I was in doubt.  I must not call you 'Mr.' and I have grown to love you, yes, my dear boy, to love you, as Arthur." Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly.  "Call me what you will," he said.  "I hope I may always have the title of a friend.  And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for
your goodness to my poor dear."  He paused a moment, and went on, "I know that she understood your goodness even better than I do.  And if I was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so, you remember"--the Professor nodded--"you must forgive me." He answered with a grave kindness, "I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such violence needs to understand, and I take it that you do not, that you cannot, trust me now, for you do not yet understand.  And there may be more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot, and may not, and must not yet understand.  But the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through.  Then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others, and for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect." "And indeed, indeed, sir," said Arthur warmly.  "I shall in all ways trust you.  I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are Jack's friend, and you were hers.  You shall do what you like." The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to speak, and finally said, "May I ask you something now?" "Certainly." "You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?" "No, poor dear.  I never thought of it." "And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy's papers and letters.  Believe me, it is no idle curiosity.  I have a motive of which, be sure, she would have approved.  I have them all here.  I took them before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch them, no strange eye look through words into her soul.  I shall keep them, if I may.  Even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them safe.  No word shall be lost, and in the good time I shall give them back to you.  It is a hard thing that I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for Lucy's sake?" Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self, "Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will.  I feel that in saying this I am doing what my dear one would have approved.  I shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes." The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly, "And you are right. There will be pain for us all, but it will not be all pain, nor will this pain be the last.  We and you too, you most of all, dear boy, will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our duty, and all will be well!" I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night.  Van Helsing did not go to bed at all.  He went to and fro, as if patroling the house, and was never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with the wild garlic flowers, which sent through the odour of lily and rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 22 September.--In the train to Exeter.  Jonathan sleeping.  It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and no news of him, and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with another attack that may harm him.  Some day he may ask me about it.  Down it all goes.  I am rusty in my shorthand, see what unexpected prosperity does for us, so it may be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow. The service was very simple and very solemn.  There were only ourselves and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the President of the Incorporated Law Society.  Jonathan and I stood hand in hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us. We came back to town quietly, taking a bus to Hyde Park Corner. Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so we sat down.  But there were very few people there, and it was sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs.  It made us think of the empty chair at home.  So we got up and walked down Piccadilly.  Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in the old days before I went to school.  I felt it very improper, for you can't go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit.  But it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn't know anybody who saw us, and we didn't care if they did, so on we walked.  I was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said under his breath, "My God!" I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may upset him again.  So I turned to him quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him. He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty girl.  He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us, and so I had a good view of him.  His face was not a good face.  It was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and big white teeth, that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's.  Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice.  I feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that I knew as much about it as he did, "Do you see who it is?" "No, dear," I said.  "I don't know him, who is it?"  His answer seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was me, Mina, to whom he was speaking.  "It is the man himself!"
The poor dear was evidently terrified at something, very greatly terrified.  I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down.  He kept staring.  A man came out of the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove off.  The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a hansom.  Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself, "I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young.  My God, if this be so!  Oh, my God!  My God!  If only I knew!  If only I knew!"  He was distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent.  I drew away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily.  We walked a little further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park.  It was a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.  After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jonathan's eyes closed, and he went quickly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder.  I thought it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him.  In about twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully, "Why, Mina, have I been asleep!  Oh, do forgive me for being so rude. Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere." He had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of.  I don't like this lapsing into forgetfulness.  It may make or continue some injury to the brain.  I must not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good, but I must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad.  The time is come, I fear, when I must open the parcel, and know what is written.  Oh, Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.
Later.--A sad homecoming in every way, the house empty of the dear soul who was so good to us.  Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady, and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he may be.  "You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and that Lucy died the day before yesterday.  They were both buried today." Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words!  Poor Mrs. Westenra!  Poor Lucy!  Gone, gone, never to return to us!  And poor, poor Arthur, to have lost such a sweetness out of his life!  God help us all to bear our troubles.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY-CONT. 22 September.--It is all over.  Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has taken Quincey Morris with him.  What a fine fellow is Quincey!  I believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy's death as any of us, but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking.  If America can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world indeed.  Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his journey.  He goes to Amsterdam tonight, but says he
returns tomorrow night, that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally.  He is to stop with me then, if he can.  He says he has work to do in London which may take him some time.  Poor old fellow!  I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength.  All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting some terrible restraint on himself.  When it was all over, we were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy's veins.  I could see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns.  Arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married, and that she was his wife in the sight of God.  None of us said a word of the other operations, and none of us ever shall.  Arthur and Quincey went away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here.  The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics.  He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted that it was only his sense of humor asserting itself under very terrible conditions.  He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge.  And then he cried, till he laughed again, and laughed and cried together, just as a woman does.  I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the circumstances, but it had no effect.  Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness!  Then when his face grew grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.  His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and forceful and mysterious.  He said, "Ah, you don't comprehend, friend John.  Do not think that I am not sad, though I laugh.  See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me.  But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come just the same.  Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say, 'May I come in?' is not true laughter. No!  He is a king, and he come when and how he like.  He ask no person, he choose no time of suitability.  He say, 'I am here.' Behold, in example I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl.  I give my blood for her, though I am old and worn.  I give my time, my skill, my sleep.  I let my other sufferers want that she may have all.  And yet I can laugh at her very grave, laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say 'Thud, thud!' to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek.  My heart bleed for that poor boy, that dear boy, so of the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his hair and eyes the same. "There, you know now why I love him so.  And yet when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my father-heart yearn to him as to no other man, not even you, friend John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son, yet even at such a moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear, 'Here I am!  Here I am!' till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek.  Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and troubles.  And yet when King Laugh come, he make them all dance to the tune he play.  Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall, all dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him.  And believe me, friend John, that he is good to come, and kind.  Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways.  Then tears
come, and like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break.  But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again, and we bear to go on with our labor, what it may be." I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea, but as I did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him.  As he answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different tone, "Oh, it was the grim irony of it all, this so lovely lady garlanded with flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead, she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother who loved her, and whom she loved, and that sacred bell going 'Toll!  Toll!  Toll!' so sad and slow, and those holy men, with the white garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time their eyes never on the page, and all of us with the bowed head. And all for what?  She is dead, so!  Is it not?" "Well, for the life of me, Professor," I said, "I can't see anything to laugh at in all that.  Why, your expression makes it a harder puzzle than before.  But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor Art and his trouble?  Why his heart was simply breaking." "Just so.  Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride?" "Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him." "Quite so.  But there was a difficulty, friend John.  If so that, then what about the others?  Ho, ho!  Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist, and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church's law, though no wits, all gone, even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife, am bigamist." "I don't see where the joke comes in there either!" I said, and I did not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things.  He laid his hand on my arm, and said, "Friend John, forgive me if I pain.  I showed not my feeling to others when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust. If you could have looked into my heart then when I want to laugh, if you could have done so when the laugh arrived, if you could do so now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him, for he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time, maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all." I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why. "Because I know!" And now we are all scattered, and for many a long day loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings.  Lucy lies in the tomb of her kin, a lordly death house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming London, where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill, and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.
So I can finish this diary, and God only knows if I shall ever begin another.  If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with different people and different themes, for here at the end, where the romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my life-work, I say sadly and without hope, "FINIS".
THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBER A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY The neighborhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as "The Kensington Horror," or "The Stabbing Woman," or "The Woman in Black."  During the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath.  In all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a "bloofer lady."  It has always been late in the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is generally supposed in the neighborhood that, as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a "bloofer lady" had asked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served.  This is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles.  A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the "bloofer lady" is supremely funny.  Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture.  It is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the "bloofer lady" should be the popular role at these al fresco performances.  Our correspondent naively says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced little children pretend, and even imagine themselves, to be. There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own.  The police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp lookout for straying children, especially when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog which may be about.
THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE, 25 SEPTEMBER EXTRA SPECIAL THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR
ANOTHER CHILD INJURED THE "BLOOFER LADY" We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the Shooter's Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is perhaps, less frequented than the other parts.  It has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases.  It was terribly weak, and looked quite emaciated.  It too, when partially restored, had the common story to tell of being lured away by the "bloofer lady".
CHAPTER 14
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 23 September.--Jonathan is better after a bad night.  I am so glad that he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible things, and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the responsibility of his new position.  I knew he would be true to himself, and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him.  He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch at home.  My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal, and lock myself up in my room and read it.
24 September.--I hadn't the heart to write last night, that terrible record of Jonathan's upset me so.  Poor dear!  How he must have suffered, whether it be true or only imagination.  I wonder if there is any truth in it at all.  Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all?  I suppose I shall never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.  And yet that man we saw yesterday!  He seemed quite certain of him, poor fellow!  I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of thought. He believes it all himself.  I remember how on our wedding day he said "Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane . . ."  There seems to be through it all some thread of continuity.  That fearful Count was coming to London. If it should be, and he came to London, with its teeming millions . . . There may be a solemn duty, and if it come we must not shrink from it.  I shall be prepared.  I shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing.  Then we shall be ready for other eyes if required.  And if it be wanted, then, perhaps, if I am ready, poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all.  If ever Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.
LETTER, VAN HELSING TO MRS. HARKER 24 September (Confidence) "Dear Madam, "I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that I sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra's death.  By the kindness of Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I am deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important.  In them I find some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you love her.  Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me.  It is for others' good that I ask, to redress great wrong, and to lift much and terrible troubles, that may be more great than you can know.  May it be that I see you?  You can trust me.  I am friend of Dr. John Seward and of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy).  I must keep it private for the present from all.  I should come to Exeter to see you at once if you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when.  I implore your pardon, Madam.  I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how good you are and how your husband suffer.  So I pray you, if it may be, enlighten him not, least it may harm.  Again your pardon, and forgive me. "VAN HELSING"
TELEGRAM, MRS. HARKER TO VAN HELSING 25 September.--Come today by quarter past ten train if you can catch it.  Can see you any time you call. "WILHELMINA HARKER"
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 25 September.--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that it will throw some light upon Jonathan's sad experience, and as he attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about her.  That is the reason of his coming.  It is concerning Lucy and her sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan.  Then I shall never know the real truth now!  How silly I am.  That awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour.  Of course it is about Lucy.  That habit came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill.  I had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards.  She must have told him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew
all about it, and now he wants me to tell him what I know, so that he may understand.  I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs. Westenra.  I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy.  I hope too, Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me.  I have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present. I suppose a cry does us all good at times, clears the air as other rain does.  Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage.  I do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will occur to upset him.  It is two o'clock, and the doctor will be here soon now.  I shall say nothing of Jonathan's journal unless he asks me.  I am so glad I have typewritten out my own journal, so that, in case he asks about Lucy, I can hand it to him. It will save much questioning. Later.--He has come and gone.  Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it all makes my head whirl round.  I feel like one in a dream.  Can it be all possible, or even a part of it?  If I had not read Jonathan's journal first, I should never have accepted even a possibility.  Poor, poor, dear Jonathan!  How he must have suffered.  Please the good God, all this may not upset him again.  I shall try to save him from it. But it may be even a consolation and a help to him, terrible though it be and awful in its consequences, to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him, and that it is all true.  It may be that it is the doubt which haunts him, that when the doubt is removed, no matter which, waking or dreaming, may prove the truth, he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock.  Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's friend and Dr. Seward's, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy.  I feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature.  When he comes tomorrow I shall ask him about Jonathan.  And then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end.  I used to think I would like to practice interviewing.  Jonathan's friend on "The Exeter News" told him that memory is everything in such work, that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards.  Here was a rare interview.  I shall try to record it verbatim. It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came.  I took my courage a deux mains and waited.  In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and announced "Dr. Van Helsing". I rose and bowed, and he came towards me, a man of medium weight, strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck.  The poise of the head strikes me at once as indicative of thought and power.  The head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears.  The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large resolute, mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens.  The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart, such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it, but falls naturally back and to the sides.
Big, dark blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man's moods.  He said to me, "Mrs. Harker, is it not?"  I bowed assent. "That was Miss Mina Murray?"  Again I assented. "It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear child Lucy Westenra.  Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead that I come." "Sir," I said, "you could have no better claim on me than that you were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra."  And I held out my hand. He took it and said tenderly, "Oh, Madam Mina, I know that the friend of that poor little girl must be good, but I had yet to learn . . ."  He finished his speech with a courtly bow.  I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at once began. "I have read your letters to Miss Lucy.  Forgive me, but I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask.  I know that you were with her at Whitby.  She sometimes kept a diary, you need not look surprised, Madam Mina.  It was begun after you had left, and was an imitation of you, and in that diary she traces by inference certain things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember." "I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it." "Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details?  It is not always so with young ladies." "No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time.  I can show it to you if you like." "Oh, Madam Mina, I well be grateful.  You will do me much favour." I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit, I suppose it is some taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths, so I handed him the shorthand diary.  He took it with a grateful bow, and said, "May I read it?" "If you wish," I answered as demurely as I could.  He opened it, and for an instant his face fell.  Then he stood up and bowed. "Oh, you so clever woman!" he said.  "I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a man of much thankfulness, but see, his wife have all the good things.  And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?  Alas!  I know not the shorthand." By this time my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed.  So I took the typewritten copy from my work basket and handed it to him. "Forgive me," I said.  "I could not help it, but I had been thinking that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not have time to wait, not on my account, but because I know your time
must be precious, I have written it out on the typewriter for you." He took it and his eyes glistened.  "You are so good," he said.  "And may I read it now?  I may want to ask you some things when I have read." "By all means," I said, "read it over whilst I order lunch, and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat." He bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light, and became so absorbed in the papers, whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed.  When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement.  He rushed up to me and took me by both hands. "Oh, Madam Mina," he said, "how can I say what I owe to you?  This paper is as sunshine.  It opens the gate to me.  I am dazed, I am dazzled, with so much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time.  But that you do not, cannot comprehend.  Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so clever woman.  Madame," he said this very solemnly, "if ever Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.  It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend, as a friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you and those you love.  There are darknesses in life, and there are lights.  You are one of the lights.  You will have a happy life and a good life, and your husband will be blessed in you." "But, doctor, you praise me too much, and you do not know me." "Not know you, I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and women, I who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him!  And I have read your diary that you have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every line.  I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your marriage and your trust, not know you!  Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that angels can read.  And we men who wish to know have in us something of angels' eyes.  Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature.  And your husband, tell me of him.  Is he quite well?  Is all that fever gone, and is he strong and hearty?" I saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I said, "He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins death." He interrupted, "Oh, yes.  I know.  I know.  I have read your last two letters." I went on, "I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he had a sort of shock." "A shock, and after brain fever so soon!  That is not good.  What kind of shock was it?" "He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something which led to his brain fever."  And here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush.  The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he
experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult.  I suppose I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him, and implored him to make my husband well again.  He took my hands and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me.  He held my hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness, "My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not had much time for friendships, but since I have been summoned to here by my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such nobility that I feel more than ever, and it has grown with my advancing years, the loneliness of my life.  Believe me, then, that I come here full of respect for you, and you have given me hope, hope, not in what I am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life happy, good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be.  I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some use to you.  For if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my study and experience.  I promise you that I will gladly do all for him that I can, all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy one.  Now you must eat.  You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.  Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale, and what he like not where he love, is not to his good.  Therefore for his sake you must eat and smile.  You have told me about Lucy, and so now we shall not speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter tonight, for I want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I will ask you questions, if I may.  And then too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan's trouble so far as you can, but not yet.  You must eat now, afterwards you shall tell me all." After lunch, when we went back to the drawing room, he said to me, "And now tell me all about him." When it came to speaking to this great learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and Jonathan a madman, that journal is all so strange, and I hesitated to go on.  But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I trusted him, so I said, "Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not laugh at me or at my husband.  I have been since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt.  You must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I have even half believed some very strange things." He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said, "Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh.  I have learned not to think little of any one's belief, no matter how strange it may be.  I have tried to keep an open mind, and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane." "Thank you, thank you a thousand times!  You have taken a weight off my mind.  If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read.  It is long, but I have typewritten it out.  It will tell you my trouble and Jonathan's.  It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that happened.  I dare not say anything of it.  You will read for yourself and judge.  And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind
and tell me what you think." "I promise," he said as I gave him the papers.  "I shall in the morning, as soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may." "Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch with us and see him then.  You could catch the quick 3:34 train, which will leave you at Paddington before eight."  He was surprised at my knowledge of the trains offhand, but he does not know that I have made up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in case he is in a hurry. So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here thinking, thinking I don't know what.
LETTER (by hand), VAN HELSING TO MRS. HARKER 25 September, 6 o'clock "Dear Madam Mina, "I have read your husband's so wonderful diary.  You may sleep without doubt.  Strange and terrible as it is, it is true!  I will pledge my life on it.  It may be worse for others, but for him and you there is no dread.  He is a noble fellow, and let me tell you from experience of men, that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that room, aye, and going a second time, is not one to be injured in permanence by a shock.  His brain and his heart are all right, this I swear, before I have even seen him, so be at rest.  I shall have much to ask him of other things.  I am blessed that today I come to see you, for I have learn all at once so much that again I am dazzled, dazzled more than ever, and I must think. "Yours the most faithful, "Abraham Van Helsing."
LETTER, MRS. HARKER TO VAN HELSING 25 September, 6:30 P.M. "My dear Dr. Van Helsing, "A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight off my mind.  And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really in London!  I fear to think.  I have this moment, whilst writing, had a wire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 tonight from Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear tonight.  Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with
us, please come to breakfast at eight o'clock, if this be not too early for you?  You can get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring you to Paddington by 2:35.  Do not answer this, as I shall take it that, if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast. "Believe me, "Your faithful and grateful friend, "Mina Harker."
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 26 September.--I thought never to write in this diary again, but the time has come.  When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing's visit, and of her having given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been about me.  She showed me in the doctor's letter that all I wrote down was true.  It seems to have made a new man of me.  It was the doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful.  But, now that I know, I am not afraid, even of the Count.  He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting to London, and it was he I saw.  He has got younger, and how?  Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what Mina says.  We sat late, and talked it over.  Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over.
He was, I think, surprised to see me.  When I came into the room where he was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny, "But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock." It was so funny to hear my wife called 'Madam Mina' by this kindly, strong-faced old man.  I smiled, and said, "I was ill, I have had a shock, but you have cured me already." "And how?" "By your letter to Mina last night.  I was in doubt, and then everything took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the evidence of my own senses.  Not knowing what to trust, I did not know what to do, and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of my life.  The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted myself.  Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even yourself.  No, you don't, you couldn't with eyebrows like yours." He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said, "So!  You are a physiognomist.  I learn more here with each hour.  I am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast, and, oh, sir, you will pardon
praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife." I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded and stood silent. "She is one of God's women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light can be here on earth.  So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an egoist, and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and selfish.  And you, sir . . . I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy, and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the knowing of others, but I have seen your true self since last night.  You will give me your hand, will you not?  And let us be friends for all our lives." We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite choky. "And now," he said, "may I ask you for some more help?  I have a great task to do, and at the beginning it is to know.  You can help me here.  Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I may ask more help, and of a different kind, but at first this will do." "Look here, Sir," I said, "does what you have to do concern the Count?" "It does," he said solemnly. "Then I am with you heart and soul.  As you go by the 10:30 train, you will not have time to read them, but I shall get the bundle of papers. You can take them with you and read them in the train." After breakfast I saw him to the station.  When we were parting he said, "Perhaps you will come to town if I send for you, and take Madam Mina too." "We shall both come when you will," I said. I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the train to start, he was turning them over.  His eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them, "The Westminster Gazette", I knew it by the colour, and he grew quite white.  He read something intently, groaning to himself, "Mein Gott!  Mein Gott!  So soon!  So soon!"  I do not think he remembered me at the moment.  Just then the whistle blew, and the train moved off.  This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of the window and waved his hand, calling out, "Love to Madam Mina.  I shall write so soon as ever I can."
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 26 September.--Truly there is no such thing as finality.  Not a week since I said "Finis," and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather going on with the record.  Until this afternoon I had no cause
to think of what is done.  Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was.  He was already well ahead with his fly business, and he had just started in the spider line also, so he had not been of any trouble to me.  I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well.  Quincey Morris is with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits.  Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy, so as to them all my mind is at rest.  As for myself, I was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened, and what is to be the end God only knows.  I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity.  He went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night.  Today he came back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o'clock, and thrust last night's "Westminster Gazette" into my hand. "What do you think of that?" he asked as he stood back and folded his arms. I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant, but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at Hampstead.  It did not convey much to me, until I reached a passage where it described small puncture wounds on their throats.  An idea struck me, and I looked up. "Well?" he said. "It is like poor Lucy's." "And what do you make of it?" "Simply that there is some cause in common.  Whatever it was that injured her has injured them."  I did not quite understand his answer. "That is true indirectly, but not directly." "How do you mean, Professor?" I asked.  I was a little inclined to take his seriousness lightly, for, after all, four days of rest and freedom from burning, harrowing, anxiety does help to restore one's spirits, but when I saw his face, it sobered me.  Never, even in the midst of our despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern. "Tell me!" I said.  "I can hazard no opinion.  I do not know what to think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture." "Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to what poor Lucy died of, not after all the hints given, not only by events, but by me?" "Of nervous prostration following a great loss or waste of blood." "And how was the blood lost or wasted?"  I shook my head. He stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on, "You are a clever
man, friend John.  You reason well, and your wit is bold, but you are too prejudiced.  You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you.  Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are, that some people see things that others cannot?  But there are things old and new which must not be contemplated by men's eyes, because they know, or think they know, some things which other men have told them.  Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all, and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain.  But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs, which think themselves new, and which are yet but the old, which pretend to be young, like the fine ladies at the opera.  I suppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference.  No?  Nor in materialization.  No?  Nor in astral bodies.  No?  Nor in the reading of thought.  No?  Nor in hypnotism . . ." "Yes," I said.  "Charcot has proved that pretty well." He smiled as he went on, "Then you are satisfied as to it.  Yes?  And of course then you understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great Charcot, alas that he is no more, into the very soul of the patient that he influence.  No?  Then, friend John, am I to take it that you simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank?  No?  Then tell me, for I am a student of the brain, how you accept hypnotism and reject the thought reading.  Let me tell you, my friend, that there are things done today in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very man who discovered electricity, who would themselves not so long before been burned as wizards.  There are always mysteries in life.  Why was it that Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and 'Old Parr' one hundred and sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men's blood in her poor veins, could not live even one day?  For, had she live one more day, we could save her.  Do you know all the mystery of life and death?  Do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew, till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps?  Can you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that come out at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their veins, how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that it is hot, flit down on them and then, and then in the morning are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?" "Good God, Professor!" I said, starting up.  "Do you mean to tell me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat, and that such a thing is here in London in the nineteenth century?" He waved his hand for silence, and went on, "Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men, why the elephant goes on and on till he have sees dynasties, and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat of dog or other complaint?  Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are men and women who cannot die?  We all know, because science has vouched for the fact, that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of
years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of the world.  Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?" Here I interrupted him.  I was getting bewildered.  He so crowded on my mind his list of nature's eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired.  I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam.  But he used them to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of thought in mind all the time.  But now I was without his help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said, "Professor, let me be your pet student again.  Tell me the thesis, so that I may apply your knowledge as you go on.  At present I am going in my mind from point to point as a madman, and not a sane one, follows an idea.  I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a midst, jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where I am going." "That is a good image," he said.  "Well, I shall tell you.  My thesis is this, I want you to believe." "To believe what?" "To believe in things that you cannot.  Let me illustrate.  I heard once of an American who so defined faith, 'that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.'  For one, I follow that man.  He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of the big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck.  We get the small truth first.  Good!  We keep him, and we value him, but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe." "Then you want me not to let some previous conviction inure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter.  Do I read your lesson aright?" "Ah, you are my favourite pupil still.  It is worth to teach you.  Now that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to understand.  You think then that those so small holes in the children's throats were made by the same that made the holes in Miss Lucy?" "I suppose so." He stood up and said solemnly, "Then you are wrong.  Oh, would it were so!  But alas!  No.  It is worse, far, far worse." "In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?" I cried. He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke. "They were made by Miss Lucy!"
CHAPTER 15
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY-cont. For a while sheer anger mastered me.  It was as if he had during her life struck Lucy on the face.  I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to him, "Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?" He raised his head and looked at me, and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once.  "Would I were!" he said.  "Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this.  Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell so simple a thing?  Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life?  Was it because I wished to give you pain?  Was it that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a fearful death?  Ah no!" "Forgive me," said I. He went on, "My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady.  But even yet I do not expect you to believe.  It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the 'no' of it.  It is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy.  Tonight I go to prove it.  Dare you come with me?" This staggered me.  A man does not like to prove such a truth, Byron excepted from the category, jealousy.    "And prove the very truth he most abhorred." He saw my hesitation, and spoke, "The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog.  If it not be true, then proof will be relief.  At worst it will not harm. If it be true!  Ah, there is the dread.  Yet every dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief.  Come, I tell you what I propose.  First, that we go off now and see that child in the hospital.  Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child is, is a friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at Amsterdam.  He will let two scientists see his case, if he will not let two friends.  We shall tell him nothing, but only that we wish to learn.  And then . . ." "And then?" He took a key from his pocket and held it up.  "And then we spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies.  This is the key that lock the tomb.  I had it from the coffin man to give to Arthur." My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us.  I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was
passing. We found the child awake.  It had had a sleep and taken some food, and altogether was going on well.  Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its throat, and showed us the punctures.  There was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat.  They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher, that was all.  We asked Vincent to what he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat, but for his own part, he was inclined to think it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London.  "Out of so many harmless ones," he said, "there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species.  Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape, or even from the Zoological Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire.  These things do occur, you, know.  Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction.  For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare came along, since then it has been quite a gala time with them.  Even this poor little mite, when he woke up today, asked the nurse if he might go away.  When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the 'bloofer lady'." "I hope," said Van Helsing, "that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it.  These fancies to stray are most dangerous, and if the child were to remain out another night, it would probably be fatal.  But in any case I suppose you will not let it away for some days?" "Certainly not, not for a week at least, longer if the wound is not healed." Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out.  When Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said, "There is not hurry.  It is more late than I thought.  Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way." We dined at 'Jack Straw's Castle' along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy.  About ten o'clock we started from the inn.  It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius.  The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly, but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to locality.  As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round.  At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over.  With some little difficulty, for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us, we found the Westenra tomb.  The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to precede him.  There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion.  My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring one.  In the latter case we should have been
in a bad plight.  Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light.  The tomb in the daytime, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough, but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns, when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance, when the time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined.  It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life, animal life, was not the only thing which could pass away. Van Helsing went about his work systematically.  Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance of Lucy's coffin.  Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew. "What are you going to do?" I asked. "To open the coffin.  You shall yet be convinced." Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath.  The sight was almost too much for me.  It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living.  I actually took hold of his hand to stop him. He only said, "You shall see," and again fumbling in his bag took out a tiny fret saw.  Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw.  I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse.  We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door.  But the Professor never stopped for a moment.  He sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side.  Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look. I drew near and looked.  The coffin was empty.  It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved.  He was now more sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task.  "Are you satisfied now, friend John?" he asked. I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I answered him, "I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin, but that only proves one thing." "And what is that, friend John?" "That it is not there." "That is good logic," he said, "so far as it goes.  But how do you, how can you, account for it not being there?"
"Perhaps a body-snatcher," I suggested.  "Some of the undertaker's people may have stolen it."  I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed.  "Ah well!" he said, "we must have more proof. Come with me." He put on the coffin lid again, gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the bag.  We opened the door, and went out.  Behind us he closed the door and locked it.  He handed me the key, saying, "Will you keep it?  You had better be assured." I laughed, it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say, as I motioned him to keep it.  "A key is nothing," I said, "there are many duplicates, and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of this kind." He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket.  Then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other. I took up my place behind a yew tree, and I saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight. It was a lonely vigil.  Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two.  I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming.  I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust, so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time. Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white streak, moving between two dark yew trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb.  At the same time a dark mass moved from the Professor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it.  Then I too moved, but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I stumbled over graves.  The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew.  A little ways off, beyond a line of scattered juniper trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb.  The tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure had disappeared.  I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child.  When he saw me he held it out to me, and said, "Are you satisfied now?" "No," I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive. "Do you not see the child?" "Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here?  And is it wounded?" "We shall see," said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child. When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat.  It was
without a scratch or scar of any kind. "Was I right?" I asked triumphantly. "We were just in time," said the Professor thankfully. We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted about it.  If we were to take it to a police station we should have to give some account of our movements during the night. At least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.  So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find it.  We would then seek our way home as quickly as we could.  All fell out well.  At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro.  We heard his exclamation of astonishment, and then we went away silently.  By good chance we got a cab near the 'Spainiards,' and drove to town. I cannot sleep, so I make this entry.  But I must try to get a few hours' sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon.  He insists that I go with him on another expedition.
27 September.--It was two o'clock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt.  The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him.  We knew that we were safe till morning did we desire it, but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most.  Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place, and I realized distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work.  Besides, I felt it was all so useless.  Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty.  I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated.  He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me to precede.  The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean looking when the sunshine streamed in.  Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.  He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange, and a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me. There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral.  She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever, and I could not believe that she was dead.  The lips were red, nay redder than before, and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom. "Is this a juggle?" I said to him. "Are you convinced now?" said the Professor, in response, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth.  "See," he went on,
"they are even sharper than before.  With this and this," and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below it, "the little children can be bitten.  Are you of belief now, friend John?" Once more argumentative hostility woke within me.  I could not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested.  So, with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said, "She may have been placed here since last night." "Indeed?  That is so, and by whom?" "I do not know.  Someone has done it." "And yet she has been dead one week.  Most peoples in that time would not look so." I had no answer for this, so was silent.  Van Helsing did not seem to notice my silence.  At any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor triumph.  He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth.  Then he turned to me and said, "Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded.  Here is some dual life that is not as the common.  She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance, sleep-walking, oh, you start.  You do not know that, friend John, but you shall know it later, and in trance could he best come to take more blood.  In trance she dies, and in trance she is UnDead, too.  So it is that she differ from all other.  Usually when the UnDead sleep at home," as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was 'home', "their face show what they are, but this so sweet that was when she not UnDead she go back to the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep." This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's theories.  But if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he said almost joyously, "Ah, you believe now?" I answered, "Do not press me too hard all at once.  I am willing to accept.  How will you do this bloody work?" "I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall drive a stake through her body." It made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved.  And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had expected.  I was, in fact, beginning to shudder at the presence of this being, this UnDead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all objective? I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as if wrapped in thought.  Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap, and said,
"I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is to be done.  But there are other things to follow, and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is simple.  She have yet no life taken, though that is of time, and to act now would be to take danger from her forever.  But then we may have to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this?  If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's at the hospital, if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full today with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she die, if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how then, can I expect Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? "He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying.  I know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say goodbye as he ought, and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive, and that in most mistake of all we have killed her.  He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas, and so he will be much unhappy always.  Yet he never can be sure, and that is the worst of all.  And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered, and again, he will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all, an UnDead.  No!  I told him once, and since then I learn much.  Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet.  He, poor fellow, must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him, then we can act for good all round and send him peace.  My mind is made up.  Let us go.  You return home for tonight to your asylum, and see that all be well.  As for me, I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way.  Tomorrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock.  I shall send for Arthur to come too, and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood.  Later we shall all have work to do.  I come with you so far as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set." So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.
NOTE LEFT BY VAN HELSING IN HIS PORTMANTEAU, BERKELEY HOTEL DIRECTED TO JOHN SEWARD, M. D. (Not Delivered) 27 September "Friend John, "I write this in case anything should happen.  I go alone to watch in that churchyard.  It pleases me that the UnDead, Miss Lucy, shall not leave tonight, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.  Therefore I shall fix some things she like not, garlic and a crucifix, and so seal up
the door of the tomb.  She is young as UnDead, and will heed.  Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out. They may not prevail on her wanting to get in, for then the UnDead is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may be.  I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it.  For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no fear, but that other to whom is there that she is UnDead, he have not the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.  He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy's life, and we lost, and in many ways the UnDead are strong.  He have always the strength in his hand of twenty men, even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him.  Besides, he can summon his wolf and I know not what.  So if it be that he came thither on this night he shall find me.  But none other shall, until it be too late.  But it may be that he will not attempt the place.  There is no reason why he should.  His hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the UnDead woman sleeps, and the one old man watch. "Therefore I write this in case . . . Take the papers that are with this, the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this great UnDead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it, so that the world may rest from him. "If it be so, farewell. "VAN HELSING."
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 28 September.--It is wonderful what a good night's sleep will do for one.  Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing's monstrous ideas, but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on common sense.  I have no doubt that he believes it all.  I wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged.  Surely there must be some rational explanation of all these mysterious things.  Is it possible that the Professor can have done it himself?  He is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way.  I am loathe to think it, and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van Helsing was mad, but anyhow I shall watch him carefully.  I may get some light on the mystery.
29 September.--Last night, at a little before ten o'clock, Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room.  He told us all what he wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all our wills were centred in his.  He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too, "for," he said, "there is a grave duty to be done there.  You were doubtless surprised at my letter?"  This query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming.
"I was.  It rather upset me for a bit.  There has been so much trouble around my house of late that I could do without any more.  I have been curious, too, as to what you mean. "Quincey and I talked it over, but the more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself that I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything." "Me too," said Quincey Morris laconically. "Oh," said the Professor, "then you are nearer the beginning, both of you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin." It was evident that he recognized my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word.  Then, turning to the other two, he said with intense gravity, "I want your permission to do what I think good this night.  It is, I know, much to ask, and when you know what it is I propose to do you will know, and only then how much.  Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a time, I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may be, you shall not blame yourselves for anything." "That's frank anyhow," broke in Quincey.  "I'll answer for the Professor.  I don't quite see his drift, but I swear he's honest, and that's good enough for me." "I thank you, Sir," said Van Helsing proudly.  "I have done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear to me."  He held out a hand, which Quincey took. Then Arthur spoke out, "Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite like to 'buy a pig in a poke', as they say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.  If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of these two, then I give my consent at once, though for the life of me, I cannot understand what you are driving at." "I accept your limitation," said Van Helsing, "and all I ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations." "Agreed!" said Arthur.  "That is only fair.  And now that the pourparlers are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?" "I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at Kingstead." Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way, "Where poor Lucy is buried?" The Professor bowed.
Arthur went on, "And when there?" "To enter the tomb!" Arthur stood up.  "Professor, are you in earnest, or is it some monstrous joke?  Pardon me, I see that you are in earnest."  He sat down again, but I could see that he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity.  There was silence until he asked again, "And when in the tomb?" "To open the coffin." "This is too much!" he said, angrily rising again.  "I am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable, but in this, this desecration of the grave, of one who . . ."  He fairly choked with indignation. The Professor looked pityingly at him.  "If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend," he said, "God knows I would.  But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths, or later, and for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!" Arthur looked up with set white face and said, "Take care, sir, take care!" "Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?" said Van Helsing. "And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose.  Shall I go on?" "That's fair enough," broke in Morris. After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort, "Miss Lucy is dead, is it not so?  Yes!  Then there can be no wrong to her. But if she be not dead . . ." Arthur jumped to his feet, "Good God!" he cried.  "What do you mean? Has there been any mistake, has she been buried alive?"  He groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften. "I did not say she was alive, my child.  I did not think it.  I go no further than to say that she might be UnDead." "UnDead!  Not alive!  What do you mean?  Is this all a nightmare, or what is it?" "There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part.  Believe me, we are now on the verge of one.  But I have not done.  May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?" "Heavens and earth, no!" cried Arthur in a storm of passion.  "Not for the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body.  Dr. Van Helsing, you try me too far.  What have I done to you that you should torture me so?  What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave?  Are you mad, that you speak of such things, or am I mad to listen to them?  Don't dare think more of such a desecration.  I shall not give my consent to anything you do.  I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage, and by God, I shall do it!"
Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and said, gravely and sternly, "My Lord Godalming, I too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty to you, a duty to the dead, and by God, I shall do it!  All I ask you now is that you come with me, that you look and listen, and if when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfillment even than I am, then, I shall do my duty, whatever it may seem to me.  And then, to follow your Lordship's wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where you will."  His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of pity. "But I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me.  In a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now.  Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow.  Just think.  For why should I give myself so much labor and so much of sorrow?  I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good, at the first to please my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom too, I come to love. For her, I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness, I gave what you gave, the blood of my veins.  I gave it, I who was not, like you, her lover, but only her physician and her friend.  I gave her my nights and days, before death, after death, and if my death can do her good even now, when she is the dead UnDead, she shall have it freely." He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it. He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice, "Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand, but at least I shall go with you and wait."
CHAPTER 16
DR SEWARD'S DIARY-cont. It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall.  The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the dents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky.  We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way.  When we had come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur, for I feared the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him, but he bore himself well.  I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief.  The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself.  The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.  He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to a coffin.  Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly.  Van Helsing said to me, "You were with me here yesterday.  Was the body of Miss Lucy in that coffin?" "It was."
The Professor turned to the rest saying, "You hear, and yet there is no one who does not believe with me." He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur looked on, very pale but silent.  When the lid was removed he stepped forward.  He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or at any rate, had not thought of it.  When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness. He was still silent.  Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and recoiled. The coffin was empty! For several minutes no one spoke a word.  The silence was broken by Quincey Morris, "Professor, I answered for you.  Your word is all I want.  I wouldn't ask such a thing ordinarily, I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a doubt, but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.  Is this your doing?" "I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed or touched her.  What happened was this.  Two nights ago my friend Seward and I came here, with good purpose, believe me.  I opened that coffin, which was then sealed up, and we found it as now, empty.  We then waited, and saw something white come through the trees.  The next day we came here in daytime and she lay there.  Did she not, friend John? "Yes." "That night we were just in time.  One more so small child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the UnDead can move.  I waited here all night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which the UnDead cannot bear, and other things which they shun.  Last night there was no exodus, so tonight before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things.  And so it is we find this coffin empty.  But bear with me.  So far there is much that is strange.  Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.  So," here he shut the dark slide of his lantern, "now to the outside."  He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind him. Oh!  But it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault.  How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing, like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life.  How sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay. How humanizing to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city.  Each in his own way was solemn and overcome.  Arthur was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery.  I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions.  Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has at stake.  Not being able to smoke, he cut
himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew.  As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a definite way.  First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin.  Next he took out a double handful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty.  He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands.  This he then took, and rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb.  I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was doing.  Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too were curious. He answered, "I am closing the tomb so that the UnDead may not enter." "And is that stuff you have there going to do it?" "It is." "What is that which you are using?"  This time the question was by Arthur.  Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered. "The Host.  I brought it from Amsterdam.  I have an Indulgence." It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust.  In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching.  I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror, and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me.  Never did tombs look so ghastly white. Never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funeral gloom.  Never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously. Never did bough creak so mysteriously, and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night. There was a long spell of silence, big, aching, void, and then from the Professor a keen "S-s-s-s!"  He pointed, and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance, a dim white figure, which held something dark at its breast.  The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds, and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.  We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child.  There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams.  We were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew tree, kept us back. And then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again.  It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognized the features of Lucy Westenra.  Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed.  The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too.  The four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb.  Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide.  By the concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips were crimson
with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe. We shuddered with horror.  I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed.  Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen. When Lucy, I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her shape, saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares, then her eyes ranged over us.  Lucy's eyes in form and colour, but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew.  At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing.  Had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight.  As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile.  Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it!  With a careless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone.  The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning.  There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur.  When she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands. She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace, said, "Come to me, Arthur.  Leave these others and come to me.  My arms are hungry for you.  Come, and we can rest together.  Come, my husband, come!" There was something diabolically sweet in her tones, something of the tinkling of glass when struck, which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under a spell, moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms.  She was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix.  She recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the tomb. When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if arrested by some irresistible force.  Then she turned, and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Helsing's nerves.  Never did I see such baffled malice on a face, and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes.  The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese.  If ever a face meant death, if looks could kill, we saw it at that moment. And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur, "Answer me, oh my friend!  Am I to proceed in my work?"
"Do as you will, friend.  Do as you will.  There can be no horror like this ever any more."  And he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms.  We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down.  Coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there.  We all looked on with horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass through the interstice where scarce a knife blade could have gone.  We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door. When this was done, he lifted the child and said, "Come now, my friends.  We can do no more till tomorrow.  There is a funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that.  The friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton locks the gate we shall remain.  Then there is more to do, but not like this of tonight.  As for this little one, he is not much harmed, and by tomorrow night he shall be well.  We shall leave him where the police will find him, as on the other night, and then to home." Coming close to Arthur, he said, "My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial, but after, when you look back, you will see how it was necessary.  You are now in the bitter waters, my child.  By this time tomorrow you will, please God, have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters.  So do not mourn over-much.  Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me." Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other on the way.  We had left behind the child in safety, and were tired. So we all slept with more or less reality of sleep.
29 September, night.--A little before twelve o'clock we three, Arthur, Quincey Morris, and myself, called for the Professor.  It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes.  Of course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct.  We got to the graveyard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton, under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to ourselves.  Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag.  It was manifestly of fair weight. When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the Professor to the tomb.  He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it behind us.  Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck by melting their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work by.  When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin we all looked, Arthur trembling like an aspen, and saw that the corpse lay there in all its death beauty.  But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her soul.  I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked.  Presently he said to Van Helsing, "Is this really Lucy's
body, or only a demon in her shape?" "It is her body, and yet not it.  But wait a while, and you shall see her as she was, and is." She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there, the pointed teeth, the blood stained, voluptuous mouth, which made one shudder to see, the whole carnal and unspirited appearance, seeming like a devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity.  Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use.  First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then small oil lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at a fierce heat with a blue flame, then his operating knives, which he placed to hand, and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long.  One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point.  With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal cellar for breaking the lumps.  To me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet. When all was ready, Van Helsing said, "Before we do anything, let me tell you this.  It is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the UnDead.  When they become such, there comes with the change the curse of immortality. They cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world.  For all that die from the preying of the Undead become themselves Undead, and prey on their kind.  And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water.  Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die, or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become nosferatu, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would for all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have filled us with horror.  The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun.  Those children whose blood she sucked are not as yet so much the worse, but if she lives on, UnDead, more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her, and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth.  But if she die in truth, then all cease.  The tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their play unknowing ever of what has been.  But of the most blessed of all, when this now UnDead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free.  Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels.  So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.  To this I am willing, but is there none amongst us who has a better right?  Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not, 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars.  It was the hand of him that loved her best, the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?'  Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?" We all looked at Arthur.  He saw too, what we all did, the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory.  He stepped
forward and said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as snow, "My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you.  Tell me what I am to do, and I shall not falter!" Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said, "Brave lad!  A moment's courage, and it is done.  This stake must be driven through her.  It well be a fearful ordeal, be not deceived in that, but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great.  From this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air.  But you must not falter when once you have begun.  Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for you all the time." "Go on," said Arthur hoarsely.  "Tell me what I am to do." "Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place to the point over the heart, and the hammer in your right.  Then when we begin our prayer for the dead, I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall follow, strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the UnDead pass away." Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered.  Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could see its dint in the white flesh.  Then he struck with all his might. The thing in the coffin writhed, and a hideous, blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips.  The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions.  The sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam.  But Arthur never faltered.  He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it.  His face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it.  The sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault. And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver.  Finally it lay still. The terrible task was over. The hammer fell from Arthur's hand.  He reeled and would have fallen had we not caught him.  The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead, and his breath came in broken gasps.  It had indeed been an awful strain on him, and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin.  When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us.  We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too, and then a glad strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it. There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded
as a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity.  True that there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and pain and waste.  But these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth to what we knew.  One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever. Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to him, "And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?" The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said, "Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again, and me peace."  He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him, "And now, my child, you may kiss her.  Kiss her dead lips if you will, as she would have you to, if for her to choose.  For she is not a grinning devil now, not any more a foul Thing for all eternity.  No longer she is the devil's UnDead.  She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!" Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the tomb.  The Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point of it in the body.  Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic.  We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin lid, and gathering up our belongings, came away.  When the Professor locked the door he gave the key to Arthur. Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch.  There was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy. Before we moved away Van Helsing said, "Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing to ourselves.  But there remains a greater task: to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out.  I have clues which we can follow, but it is a long task, and a difficult one, and there is danger in it, and pain. Shall you not all help me?  We have learned to believe, all of us, is it not so?  And since so, do we not see our duty?  Yes!  And do we not promise to go on to the bitter end?" Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made.  Then said the Professor as we moved off, "Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend John.  I shall entreat two others, two that you know not as yet, and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans unfold.  Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult you about, and you can help me. Tonight I leave for Amsterdam, but shall return tomorrow night.  And then begins our great quest.  But first I shall have much to say, so that you may know what to do and to dread.  Then our promise shall be made to each other anew.  For there is a terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back."
CHAPTER 17
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY-cont. When we arrived at the Berkely Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram waiting for him. "Am coming up by train.  Jonathan at Whitby.  Important news.  Mina Harker."
The Professor was delighted.  "Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina," he said, "pearl among women!  She arrive, but I cannot stay.  She must go to your house, friend John.  You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her en route so that she may be prepared." When the wire was dispatched he had a cup of tea.  Over it he told me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's diary at Whitby. "Take these," he said, "and study them well.  When I have returned you will be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition.  Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of today.  What is here told," he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke, "may be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another, or it may sound the knell of the UnDead who walk the earth.  Read all, I pray you, with the open mind, and if you can add in any way to the story here told do so, for it is all important.  You have kept a diary of all these so strange things, is it not so?  Yes!  Then we shall go through all these together when we meet."  He then made ready for his departure and shortly drove off to Liverpool Street.  I took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in. The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms, and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty looking girl stepped up to me, and after a quick glance said, "Dr. Seward, is it not?" "And you are Mrs. Harker!" I answered at once, whereupon she held out her hand. "I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy, but . . ."  She stopped suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face. The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it was a tacit answer to her own.  I got her luggage, which included a typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting room and a bedroom prepared at once for Mrs. Harker. In due time we arrived.  She knew, of course, that the place was a lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder when we entered.
She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as she had much to say.  So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilst I await her.  As yet I have not had the chance of looking at the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before me.  I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an opportunity of reading them.  She does not know how precious time is, or what a task we have in hand.  I must be careful not to frighten her.  Here she is!
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 29 September.--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward's study.  At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking with some one.  As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at the door, and on his calling out, "Come in," I entered. To my intense surprise, there was no one with him.  He was quite alone, and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the description to be a phonograph.  I had never seen one, and was much interested. "I hope I did not keep you waiting," I said, "but I stayed at the door as I heard you talking, and thought there was someone with you." "Oh," he replied with a smile, "I was only entering my diary." "Your diary?" I asked him in surprise. "Yes," he answered.  "I keep it in this."  As he spoke he laid his hand on the phonograph.  I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out, "Why, this beats even shorthand!  May I hear it say something?" "Certainly," he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train for speaking.  Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face. "The fact is," he began awkwardly, "I only keep my diary in it, and as it is entirely, almost entirely, about my cases it may be awkward, that is, I mean . . ."  He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his embarrassment. "You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end.  Let me hear how she died, for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful.  She was very, very dear to me." To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face, "Tell you of her death?  Not for the wide world!" "Why not?" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me. Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.  At length, he stammered out, "You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary." Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said with
unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naivete of a child, "that's quite true, upon my honour.  Honest Indian!" I could not but smile, at which he grimaced.  "I gave myself away that time!" he said.  "But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up?" By this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and I said boldly, "Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter." He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said, "No!  No!  No!  For all the world.  I wouldn't let you know that terrible story!" Then it was terrible.  My intuition was right!  For a moment, I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table.  His eyes caught the look in mine, and without his thinking, followed their direction.  As they saw the parcel he realized my meaning. "You do not know me," I said.  "When you have read those papers, my own diary and my husband's also, which I have typed, you will know me better.  I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause.  But, of course, you do not know me, yet, and I must not expect you to trust me so far." He is certainly a man of noble nature.  Poor dear Lucy was right about him.  He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and said, "You are quite right.  I did not trust you because I did not know you.  But I know you now, and let me say that I should have known you long ago.  I know that Lucy told you of me.  She told me of you too. May I make the only atonement in my power?  Take the cylinders and hear them.  The first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify you.  Then you will know me better.  Dinner will by then be ready.  In the meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better able to understand certain things." He carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting room and adjusted it for me.  Now I shall learn something pleasant, I am sure.  For it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which I know one side already.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 29 September.--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without thinking.  Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner, so I said, "She is possibly tired.  Let dinner wait an hour," and I went on with my work.  I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary,
when she came in.  She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were flushed with crying.  This somehow moved me much.  Of late I have had cause for tears, God knows!  But the relief of them was denied me, and now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened by recent tears, went straight to my heart.  So I said as gently as I could, "I greatly fear I have distressed you." "Oh, no, not distressed me," she replied.  "But I have been more touched than I can say by your grief.  That is a wonderful machine, but it is cruelly true.  It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.  It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God.  No one must hear them spoken ever again!  See, I have tried to be useful.  I have copied out the words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as I did." "No one need ever know, shall ever know," I said in a low voice.  She laid her hand on mine and said very gravely, "Ah, but they must!" "Must!  But why?" I asked. "Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor Lucy's death and all that led to it.  Because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get.  I think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know.  But I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery.  You will let me help, will you not?  I know all up to a certain point, and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought out.  Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us.  He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he will be here tomorrow to help us.  We need have no secrets amongst us.  Working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark." She looked at me so appealingly, and at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing, that I gave in at once to her wishes.  "You shall," I said, "do as you like in the matter.  God forgive me if I do wrong!  There are terrible things yet to learn of, but if you have so far traveled on the road to poor Lucy's death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the dark.  Nay, the end, the very end, may give you a gleam of peace.  Come, there is dinner.  We must keep one another strong for what is before us.  We have a cruel and dreadful task.  When you have eaten you shall learn the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask, if there be anything which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were present."
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 29 September.--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study.  He brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took a chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case I should want to pause.  Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read.  I put the forked metal to my ears and listened.
When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and all that followed, was done, I lay back in my chair powerless.  Fortunately I am not of a fainting disposition.  When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case bottle from the cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored me.  My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without making a scene.  It is all so wild and mysterious, and strange that if I had not known Jonathan's experience in Transylvania I could not have believed.  As it was, I didn't know what to believe, and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else.  I took the cover off my typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward, "Let me write this all out now.  We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing when he comes.  I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when he arrives in London from Whitby.  In this matter dates are everything, and I think that if we get all of our material ready, and have every item put in chronological order, we shall have done much. "You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too.  Let us be able to tell them when they come." He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventeenth cylinder.  I used manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with the rest.  It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going his round of the patients.  When he had finished he came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked.  How good and thoughtful he is.  The world seems full of good men, even if there are monsters in it. Before I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor's perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at Exeter, so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the files of 'The Westminster Gazette' and 'The Pall Mall Gazette' and took them to my room.  I remember how much the 'Dailygraph' and 'The Whitby Gazette', of which I had made cuttings, had helped us to understand the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new light.  I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 30 September.--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock.  He got his wife's wire just before starting.  He is uncommonly clever, if one can judge from his face, and full of energy.  If this journal be true, and judging by one's own wonderful experiences, it must be, he is also a man of great nerve.  That going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring.  After reading his account of it I was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet, businesslike gentleman who came here today.
LATER.--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room, and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter.  They are hard at it.  Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have.  Harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them.  He is now reading his wife's transcript of my diary.  I wonder what they make out of it. Here it is . . . Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the Count's hiding place!  Goodness knows that we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient Renfield!  The bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the transcript.  Oh, if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!  Stop!  That way madness lies!  Harker has gone back, and is again collecting material. He says that by dinner time they will be able to show a whole connected narrative.  He thinks that in the meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the Count.  I hardly see this yet, but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall.  What a good thing that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type!  We never could have found the dates otherwise. I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded, smiling benignly.  At the moment he seemed as sane as any one I ever saw.  I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which he treated naturally.  He then, of his own accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here.  In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once.  I believe that, had I not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation.  As it is, I am darkly suspicious.  All those out-breaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the Count.  What then does this absolute content mean?  Can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?  Stay.  He is himself zoophagous, and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of 'master'.  This all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came away.  My friend is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think, and then . . . So I came away.  I mistrust these quiet moods of of his, so I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to have a strait waistcoat ready in case of need.
JOHNATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 29 September, in train to London.--When I received Mr. Billington's courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such inquiries as I wanted.  It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count's to its place in London.  Later, we may be able to deal with it.  Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and brought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I
must spend the night.  They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality, give a guest everything and leave him to do as he likes. They all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.  It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count's table before I knew of his diabolical plans.  Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision.  He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out.  To use an Americanism, he had 'taken no chances', and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled was simply the logical result of his care.  I saw the invoice, and took note of it.  'Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes'.  Also the copy of the letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply.  Of both these I got copies.  This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs Officers and the harbour master, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes.  Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add to the simple description 'fifty cases of common earth', except that the boxes were 'main and mortal heavy', and that shifting them was dry work.  One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't any gentleman 'such like as like yourself, squire', to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form.  Another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it.  Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, forever and adequately, this source of reproach. 30 September.--The station master was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the station master at King's Cross, so that when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes.  He, too put me at once in communication with the proper officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice.  The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited.  A noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was compelled to deal with the result in ex post facto manner. From thence I went to Carter Paterson's central office, where I met with the utmost courtesy.  They looked up the transaction in their day book and letter book, and at once telephoned to their King's Cross office for more details.  By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax.  Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly.  The carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few more details.  These were, I shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and the consequent thirst engendered in the operators.  On my affording an opportunity, through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked, "That 'ere 'ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest I ever was in.  Blyme!  But it ain't been touched sence a hundred years.  There was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep' on it without 'urtin' of yer bones.  An' the place was that neglected that yer might 'ave smelled ole Jerusalem in it.  But the old chapel, that took the cike,
that did!  Me and my mate, we thort we wouldn't never git out quick enough.  Lor', I wouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark." Having been in the house, I could well believe him, but if he knew what I know, he would, I think have raised his terms. Of one thing I am now satisfied.  That all those boxes which arrived at Whitby from Varna in the Demeter were safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax.  There should be fifty of them there, unless any have since been removed, as from Dr. Seward's diary I fear.
Later.--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers into order.
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 30 September.--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself. It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had, that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on Jonathan.  I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as could, but I was sick with apprehension.  The effort has, however, done him good.  He was never so resolute, never so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present.  It is just as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said, he is true grit, and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature.  He came back full of life and hope and determination.  We have got everything in order for tonight.  I feel myself quite wild with excitement.  I suppose one ought to pity anything so hunted as the Count.  That is just it.  This thing is not human, not even a beast.  To read Dr. Seward's account of poor Lucy's death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one's heart.
Later.--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected.  Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with him, so I had to see them.  It was to me a painful meeting, for it brought back all poor dear Lucy's hopes of only a few months ago.  Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsing, too, had been quite 'blowing my trumpet', as Mr. Morris expressed it.  Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all about the proposals they made to Lucy.  They did not quite know what to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge.  So they had to keep on neutral subjects.  However, I thought the matter over, and came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post them on affairs right up to date.  I knew from Dr. Seward's diary that they had been at Lucy's death, her real death, and that I need not fear to betray any secret before the time.  So I told them, as well as I could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.  I gave them each a copy to read in the library.  When Lord Godalming got his and turned it over, it does make a pretty good pile, he said, "Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?"
I nodded, and he went on. "I don't quite see the drift of it, but you people are all so good and kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you.  I have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life.  Besides, I know you loved my Lucy . . ." Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands.  I could hear the tears in his voice.  Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the room.  I suppose there is something in a woman's nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood.  For when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly.  I sat down beside him and took his hand.  I hope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought.  There I wrong him.  I know he never will.  He is too true a gentleman.  I said to him, for I could see that his heart was breaking, "I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to her.  She and I were like sisters, and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?  I know what sorrows you have had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service, for Lucy's sake?" In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief.  It seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once.  He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief.  He stood up and then sat down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks.  I felt an infinite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly.  With a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with emotion. We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother spirit is invoked.  I felt this big sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of a baby that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child.  I never thought at the time how strange it all was. After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion.  He told me that for days and nights past, weary days and sleepless nights, he had been unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow.  There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded, he could speak freely. "I know now how I suffered," he said, as he dried his eyes, "but I do not know even yet, and none other can ever know, how much your sweet sympathy has been to me today.  I shall know better in time, and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding.  You will let me be like a brother, will you not, for all our lives, for dear Lucy's sake?"
"For dear Lucy's sake," I said as we clasped hands.  "Ay, and for your own sake," he added, "for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning, you have won mine today.  If ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a man's help, believe me, you will not call in vain.  God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life, but if it should ever come, promise me that you will let me know." He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I felt it would comfort him, so I said, "I promise." As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window. He turned as he heard my footsteps.  "How is Art?" he said.  Then noticing my red eyes, he went on, "Ah, I see you have been comforting him.  Poor old fellow!  He needs it.  No one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart, and he had no one to comfort him." He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him.  I saw the manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realize how much I knew, so I said to him, "I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart.  Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it?  You will know later why I speak." He saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it.  It seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I bent over and kissed him.  The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a momentary choking in his throat.  He said quite calmly, "Little girl, you will never forget that true hearted kindness, so long as ever you live!"  Then he went into the study to his friend. "Little girl!"  The very words he had used to Lucy, and, oh, but he proved himself a friend.
CHAPTER 18
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 30 September.--I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me.  Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I have lived in it, this old house seemed like home.  When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said, "Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour?  I want to see your patient, Mr. Renfield.  Do let me see him.  What you have said of him in your diary interests me so much!" She looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not refuse her, and
there was no possible reason why I should, so I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a lady would like to see him, to which he simply answered, "Why?" "She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it," I answered. "Oh, very well," he said, "let her come in, by all means, but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place." His method of tidying was peculiar, he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop him.  It was quite evident that he feared, or was jealous of, some interference.  When he had got through his disgusting task, he said cheerfully, "Let the lady come in," and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered.  For a moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent.  I remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic, for easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect.  She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and held out her hand. "Good evening, Mr. Renfield," said she.  "You see, I know you, for Dr. Seward has told me of you."  He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face.  This look gave way to one of wonder, which merged in doubt, then to my intense astonishment he said, "You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you?  You can't be, you know, for she's dead." Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied, "Oh no!  I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever saw Dr. Seward, or he me.  I am Mrs. Harker." "Then what are you doing here?" "My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward." "Then don't stay." "But why not?" I thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in, "How did you know I wanted to marry anyone?" His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs. Harker to me, instantly turning them back again, "What an asinine question!" "I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield," said Mrs. Harker, at once championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt to me, "You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that
when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of interest in our little community.  Dr. Seward is loved not only by his household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects.  Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenche." I positively opened my eyes at this new development.  Here was my own pet lunatic, the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met with, talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman.  I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched some chord in his memory.  If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or power. We continued to talk for some time, and seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she began, to lead him to his favourite topic.  I was again astonished, for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity.  He even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things. "Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being put under control.  I used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong life.  At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to take human life.  The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood, relying of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is the life.'  Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarized the truism to the very point of contempt.  Isn't that true, doctor?" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to either think or say, it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before.  Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs. Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield, "Goodbye, and I hope I may see you often, under auspices pleasanter to yourself." To which, to my astonishment, he replied, "Goodbye, my dear.  I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.  May He bless and keep you!" When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind me.  Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long day. Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
boy.  He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying, "Ah, friend John, how goes all?  Well?  So!  I have been busy, for I come here to stay if need be.  All affairs are settled with me, and I have much to tell.  Madam Mina is with you?  Yes.  And her so fine husband?  And Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too?  Good!" As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion, at which the Professor interrupted me. "Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina!  She has man's brain, a brain that a man should have were he much gifted, and a woman's heart.  The good God fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good combination.  Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us, after tonight she must not have to do with this so terrible affair.  It is not good that she run a risk so great.  We men are determined, nay, are we not pledged, to destroy this monster?  But it is no part for a woman.  Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors and hereafter she may suffer, both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams.  And, besides, she is young woman and not so long married, there may be other things to think of some time, if not now.  You tell me she has wrote all, then she must consult with us, but tomorrow she say goodbye to this work, and we go alone." I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we had found in his absence, that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to my own.  He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him. "Oh that we had known it before!" he said, "for then we might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy.  However, 'the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say.  We shall not think of that, but go on our way to the end."  Then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway.  Before we went to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker, "I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment." "Not up to this moment, Professor," she said impulsively, "but up to this morning." "But why not up to now?  We have seen hitherto how good light all the little things have made.  We have told our secrets, and yet no one who has told is the worse for it." Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she said, "Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in.  It is my record of today.  I too have seen the need of putting down at present everything, however trivial, but there is little in this except what is personal.  Must it go in?" The Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back, saying, "It need not go in if you do not wish it, but I pray that it may.  It can but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more honour you, as well as more esteem and love."  She took it back with another blush and a bright smile.
And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete and in order.  The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner, and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock.  The rest of us have already read everything, so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy.
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 30 September.--When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after dinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee.  Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room.  He made me sit next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary.  Jonathan sat next to me.  Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris, Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the centre. The Professor said, "I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers."  We all expressed assent, and he went on, "Then it were, I think, good that I tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal.  I shall then make known to you something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.  So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure according. "There are such beings as vampires, some of us have evidence that they exist.  Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples.  I admit that at the first I was sceptic.  Were it not that through long years I have trained myself to keep an open mind, I could not have believed until such time as that fact thunder on my ear.  'See! See!  I prove, I prove.'  Alas!  Had I known at first what now I know, nay, had I even guess at him, one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her.  But that is gone, and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save.  The nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once.  He is only stronger, and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil.  This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men, he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages, he have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within his range, direct the elements, the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command all the meaner things, the rat, and the owl, and the bat, the moth, and the fox, and the wolf, he can grow and become small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown.  How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?  How shall we find his where, and having found it, how can we destroy?  My friends, this is much, it is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win, and then where end we?  Life is nothings, I heed him not.  But to fail here, is not mere life or death.  It is that we become as him, that we henceforward
become foul things of the night like him, without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best.  To us forever are the gates of heaven shut, for who shall open them to us again?  We go on for all time abhorred by all, a blot on the face of God's sunshine, an arrow in the side of Him who died for man.  But we are face to face with duty, and in such case must we shrink?  For me, I say no, but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind.  You others are young.  Some have seen sorrow, but there are fair days yet in store.  What say you?" Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand.  I feared, oh so much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I saw his hand stretch out, but it was life to me to feel its touch, so strong, so self reliant, so resolute.  A brave man's hand can speak for itself, it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music. When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I in his, there was no need for speaking between us. "I answer for Mina and myself," he said. "Count me in, Professor," said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual. "I am with you," said Lord Godalming, "for Lucy's sake, if for no other reason." Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side.  I took his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left, Jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris.  So as we all took hands our solemn compact was made.  I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even occur to me to draw back.  We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun.  It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way, as any other transaction of life. "Well, you know what we have to contend against, but we too, are not without strength.  We have on our side power of combination, a power denied to the vampire kind, we have sources of science, we are free to act and think, and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.  In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are free to use them.  We have self devotion in a cause and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one.  These things are much. "Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict, and how the individual cannot.  In fine, let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular. "All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions.  These do not at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death, nay of more than either life or death.  Yet must we be satisfied, in the first place because we have to be, no other means is at our control, and secondly, because, after all these things, tradition and superstition, are everything.  Does not the belief in
vampires rest for others, though not, alas! for us, on them?  A year ago which of us would have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century?  We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes.  Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the moment on the same base.  For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that men have been.  In old Greece, in old Rome, he flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chermosese, and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples for him at this day.  He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. "So far, then, we have all we may act upon, and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience.  The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time, he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living.  Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger, that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. "But he cannot flourish without this diet, he eat not as others.  Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him eat, never!  He throws no shadow, he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe.  He has the strength of many of his hand, witness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolves, and when he help him from the diligence too.  He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog, he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. "He can come in mist which he create, that noble ship's captain proved him of this, but, from what we know, the distance he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. "He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust, as again Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula.  He become so small, we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door.  He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire, solder you call it.  He can see in the dark, no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the light.  Ah, but hear me through. "He can do all these things, yet he is not free.  Nay, he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell. He cannot go where he lists, he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature's laws, why we know not.  He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come, though afterwards he can come as he please.  His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. "Only at certain times can he have limited freedom.  If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.  These things we are told, and in this record of ours we have proof by inference.  Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he have his earth-home, his
coffin-home, his hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at Whitby, still at other time he can only change when the time come.  It is said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide.  Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power, as the garlic that we know of, and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect.  There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our seeking we may need them. "The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it, a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead, and as for the stake through him, we know already of its peace, or the cut off head that giveth rest.  We have seen it with our eyes. "Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know.  But he is clever.  I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make his record, and from all the means that are, he tell me of what he has been.  He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkeyland.  If it be so, then was he no common man, for in that time, and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the forest.'  That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave, and are even now arrayed against us.  The Draculas were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One.  They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due.  In the records are such words as 'stregoica' witch, 'ordog' and 'pokol' Satan and hell, and in one manuscript this very Dracula is spoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well.  There have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell.  For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good, in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest." Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window, and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room.  There was a little pause, and then the Professor went on. "And now we must settle what we do.  We have here much data, and we must proceed to lay out our campaign.  We know from the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which were delivered at Carfax, we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed.  It seems to me, that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look today, or whether any more have been removed. If the latter, we must trace . . ." Here we were interrupted in a very startling way.  Outside the house came the sound of a pistol shot, the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet, which ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the far wall of the room.  I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked out.  The men all jumped to their feet, Lord Godalming
flew over to the window and threw up the sash.  As he did so we heard Mr. Morris' voice without, "Sorry!  I fear I have alarmed you.  I shall come in and tell you about it." A minute later he came in and said, "It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker, most sincerely, I fear I must have frightened you terribly.  But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat and sat on the window sill. I have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have seen one.  You used to laugh at me for it then, Art." "Did you hit it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing. "I don't know, I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood."  Without saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his statement. "We must trace each of these boxes, and when we are ready, we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair, or we must, so to speak, sterilize the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it. Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak. "And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well. You are too precious to us to have such risk.  When we part tonight, you no more must question.  We shall tell you all in good time.  We are men and are able to bear, but you must be our star and our hope, and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we are." All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved, but it did not seem to me good that they should brave danger and, perhaps lessen their safety, strength being the best safety, through care of me, but their minds were made up, and though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me. Mr. Morris resumed the discussion, "As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right now.  Time is everything with him, and swift action on our part may save another victim." I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether.  They have now gone off to Carfax, with means to get into the house. Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep, as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger!  I shall lie down, and pretend to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
1 October, 4 A.M.--Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.  I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning, I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added, "He seems very importunate, sir.  I have never seen him so eager.  I don't know but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of his violent fits."  I knew the man would not have said this without some cause, so I said, "All right, I'll go now," and I asked the others to wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my patient. "Take me with you, friend John," said the Professor.  "His case in your diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on our case.  I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is disturbed." "May I come also?" asked Lord Godalming. "Me too?" said Quincey Morris.  "May I come?" said Harker.  I nodded, and we all went down the passage together. We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him.  There was an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever met with in a lunatic, and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane.  We all five went into the room, but none of the others at first said anything.  His request was that I would at once release him from the asylum and send him home.  This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own existing sanity. "I appeal to your friends," he said, "they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgement on my case.  By the way, you have not introduced me." I was so much astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment, and besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much of the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction, "Lord Godalming, Professor Van Helsing, Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas, Mr. Jonathan Harker, Mr. Renfield." He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn, "Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no more.  He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him, and in his youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much patronized on Derby night.  Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great state.  Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes.  The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable.  What shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Helsing?  Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix.  When an individual has revolutionized
therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain matter, conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to one of a class.  You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.  And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances."  He made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm. I think we were all staggered.  For my own part, I was under the conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history, that his reason had been restored, and I felt under a strong impulse to tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning.  I thought it better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.  So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly, that I would have a longer chat with him in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly, "But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish.  I desire to go at once, here, now, this very hour, this very moment, if I may.  Time presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract.  I am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment." He looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinized them closely.  Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on, "Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?" "You have," I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally. There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly, "Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request.  Let me ask for this concession, boon, privilege, what you will.  I am content to implore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others.  I am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons, but you may, I assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. "Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me.  Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends." Again he looked at us all keenly.  I had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another phase of his madness, and so determined to let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end.  Van Helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look.  He said to Renfield in a
tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it afterwards, for it was as of one addressing an equal, "Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free tonight?  I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me, a stranger, without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind, Dr. Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the privilege you seek." He shook his head sadly, and with a look of poignant regret on his face.  The Professor went on, "Come, sir, bethink yourself.  You claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness.  You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect.  If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us?  Be wise, and help us, and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish." He still shook his head as he said, "Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say.  Your argument is complete, and if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment, but I am not my own master in the matter.  I can only ask you to trust me.  If I am refused, the responsibility does not rest with me." I thought it was now time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went towards the door, simply saying, "Come, my friends, we have work to do.  Goodnight." As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack.  My fears, however, were groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his petition in a moving manner.  As he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old relations, he became still more demonstrative.  I glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes, so I became a little more fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing.  I had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much, such for instance, as when he wanted a cat, and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realized, for when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into quite a frantic condition.  He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion. "Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out of this house at once.  Send me away how you will and where you will, send keepers with me with whips and chains, let them take me in a strait waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to gaol, but let me go out of this.  You don't know what you do by keeping me here.  I am speaking from the depths of my heart, of my very soul.  You don't know whom you wrong, or how, and I may not tell.  Woe is me!  I may not tell.  By all you hold sacred, by all you hold dear, by your love that
is lost, by your hope that lives, for the sake of the Almighty, take me out of this and save my soul from guilt!  Can't you hear me, man? Can't you understand?  Will you never learn?  Don't you know that I am sane and earnest now, that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul?  Oh, hear me!  Hear me!  Let me go, let me go, let me go!" I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so would bring on a fit, so I took him by the hand and raised him up. "Come," I said sternly, "no more of this, we have had quite enough already.  Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly." He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the bed.  The collapse had come, as on former occasions, just as I had expected. When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a quiet, well-bred voice, "You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later on, that I did what I could to convince you tonight."
CHAPTER 19
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 1 October, 5 A.M.--I went with the party to the search with an easy mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well.  I am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work. Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all, but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us.  We were, I think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield.  When we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward, "Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the sanest lunatic I ever saw.  I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance." Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added, "Friend John, you know more lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it, for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last hysterical outburst have given him free.  But we live and learn, and in our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.  All is best as they are." Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way, "I don't know but that I agree with you.  If that man had been an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him, but he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am
afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads.  I can't forget how he prayed with almost equal fervor for a cat, and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth.  Besides, he called the Count 'lord and master', and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.  That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic.  He certainly did seem earnest, though.  I only hope we have done what is best.  These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man." The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way, "Friend John, have no fear.  We are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case, we can only do as we deem best.  What else have we to hope for, except the pity of the good God?" Lord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but now he returned.  He held up a little silver whistle as he remarked, "That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on call." Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out.  When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four little groups, evidently one for each.  Then he spoke. "My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of many kinds.  Our enemy is not merely spiritual.  Remember that he has the strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind, and therefore breakable or crushable, his are not amenable to mere strength.  A stronger man, or a body of men more strong in all than him, can at certain times hold him, but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him.  We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his touch.  Keep this near your heart."  As he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him, "put these flowers round your neck," here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms, "for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife, and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast, and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless." This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me.  Each of the others was similarly equipped. "Now," he said, "friend John, where are the skeleton keys?  If so that we can open the door, we need not break house by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's." Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead.  Presently he got one to suit, after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and with a rusty clang, shot back.  We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it slowly opened.  It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb, I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they shrank back.  The Professor was the first to move
forward, and stepped into the open door. "In manus tuas, Domine!" he said, crossing himself as he passed over the threshold.  We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road.  The Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit.  Then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search. The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows.  I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was someone else amongst us.  I suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience in Transylvania.  I think the feeling was common to us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing. The whole place was thick with dust.  The floor was seemingly inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each.  They had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor lifted them. He turned to me and said, "You know this place, Jonathan.  You have copied maps of it, and you know it at least more than we do.  Which is the way to the chapel?" I had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to get admission to it, so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands. "This is the spot," said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase.  With a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door.  We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered.  None of the others had met the Count at all at close quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or, when he was bloated with fresh blood, in a ruined building open to the air, but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul.  There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler air.  But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it?  It was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt.  Faugh!  It sickens me to think of it.  Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness.
Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end, but this was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations.  After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses. We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we began, "The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left, we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest." A glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them. There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty!  Once I got a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still.  Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor.  It was only for a moment, for, as Lord Godalming said, "I thought I saw a face, but it was only the shadows," and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage.  There was no sign of anyone, and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hiding place even for him.  I took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing. A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which he was examining.  We all followed his movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars.  We all instinctively drew back.  The whole place was becoming alive with rats. For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency.  Rushing over to the great iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside, and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open.  Then, taking his little silver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call.  It was answered from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.  Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed.  The boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way.  But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies.  The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion.  The rats were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out. Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him on the floor.  The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to
recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies.  They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished. With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes.  We all seemed to find our spirits rise. Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not, but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution.  We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house.  We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.  Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit hunting in a summer wood. The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front. Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall door from the bunch, and locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket when he had done. "So far," he said, "our night has been eminently successful.  No harm has come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing.  More than all do I rejoice that this, our first, and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous, step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget.  One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue a particulari, that the brute beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power, for look, these rats that would come to his call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur.  We have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears, and that monster . . . He has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time tonight.  So be it that he has gone elsewhere.  Good!  It has given us opportunity to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls.  And now let us go home.  The dawn is close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our first night's work.  It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril, but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink." The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfield's room.  The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain. I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it.  She looks paler than
usual.  I hope the meeting tonight has not upset her.  I am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our deliberations.  It is too great a strain for a woman to bear.  I did not think so at first, but I know better now.  Therefore I am glad that it is settled.  There may be things which would frighten her to hear, and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment.  Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world.  I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours, but I must be resolute, and tomorrow I shall keep dark over tonight's doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened.  I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.
1 October, later.--I suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no rest at all.  Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or three times before she awoke.  Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream.  She complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the day.  We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all.  Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labor, and the sooner the matter is attended to the better.  I shall look up Thomas Snelling today.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 1 October.--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor walking into my room.  He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said, "Your patient interests me much.  May it be that with you I visit him this morning?  Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound." I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to keep him waiting, so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient. "But," he answered, "I want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things.  He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that he had once had such a belief.  Why do you smile, friend John?" "Excuse me," I said, "but the answer is here."  I laid my hand on the typewritten matter.  "When our sane and learned lunatic made that very
statement of how he used to consume life, his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs. Harker entered the room." Van Helsing smiled in turn.  "Good!" he said.  "Your memory is true, friend John.  I should have remembered.  And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study.  Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.  Who knows?" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in hand.  It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in the study. "Do I interrupt?" he asked politely as he stood at the door. "Not at all," I answered.  "Come in.  My work is finished, and I am free.  I can go with you now, if you like." "It is needless, I have seen him!" "Well?" "I fear that he does not appraise me at much.  Our interview was short.  When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen discontent.  I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect as I could assume.  He made no reply whatever.  'Don't you know me?' I asked.  His answer was not reassuring: 'I know you well enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing.  I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else.  Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen!'  Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at all.  Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic, so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina.  Friend John, it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with our terrible things.  Though we shall much miss her help, it is better so." "I agree with you with all my heart," I answered earnestly, for I did not want him to weaken in this matter.  "Mrs. Harker is better out of it.  Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have been in many tight places in our time, but it is no place for a woman, and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time infallibly have wrecked her." So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker, Quincey and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth boxes.  I shall finish my round of work and we shall meet tonight.
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL
1 October.--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am today, after Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see him manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier.  He spoke to me before he went out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the Count's house.  And yet he must have known how terribly anxious I was.  Poor dear fellow!  I suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me.  They all agreed that it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and I acquiesced.  But to think that he keeps anything from me!  And now I am crying like a silly fool, when I know it comes from my husband's great love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men. That has done me good.  Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all.  And lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual.  Then if he has feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eyes to read.  I feel strangely sad and low-spirited today.  I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement. Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told me to.  I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety.  I kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored.  If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now.  She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day time with me she wouldn't have walked in her sleep.  And if she hadn't gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.  Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby?  There now, crying again!  I wonder what has come over me today.  I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one morning . . . I, who never cried on my own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear, the dear fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do feel weepy, he shall never see it.  I suppose it is just one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn . . . I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night.  I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere under this.  And then there was silence over everything, silence so profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.  All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own.  Not a thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate, so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own.  I think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy creeping over me.  I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out and looked out of the window again.  The
mist was spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows.  The poor man was more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said, I could in some way recognize in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part.  Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.  I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought, but I must have fallen asleep, for except dreams, I do not remember anything until the morning, when Jonathan woke me.  I think that it took me an effort and a little time to realize where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams. I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back.  I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act, my feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace.  And so I slept uneasily and thought.  Then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold.  I put back the clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim around.  The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room.  Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed.  I would have got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will.  I lay still and endured, that was all.  I closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids.  (It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.)  The mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke, or with the white energy of boiling water, pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of the door.  It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye.  Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words "a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night."  Was it indeed such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep?  But the pillar was composed of both the day and the night guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me, till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became black darkness.  The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there were too much of them.  I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm them.  Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me.  Tonight I shall strive hard to sleep naturally.  If I do not, I shall tomorrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral, that cannot hurt me for once, and it will give
me a good night's sleep.  Last night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.
2 October 10 P.M.--Last night I slept, but did not dream.  I must have slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed, but the sleep has not refreshed me, for today I feel terribly weak and spiritless.  I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.  In the afternoon, Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me.  Poor man, he was very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless me.  Some way it affected me much.  I am crying when I think of him.  This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be miserable if he knew I had been crying.  He and the others were out till dinner time, and they all came in tired.  I did what I could to brighten them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how tired I was.  After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day. I could see from Jonathan's manner that he had something important to communicate.  I was not so sleepy as I should have been, so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night before.  He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild . . . I have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof.  I hope I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking.  I might want it.  Here comes sleep.  Goodnight.
CHAPTER 20
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 1 October, evening.--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch.  I learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he was only the assistant of Smollet, who of the two mates was the responsible person.  So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer.  He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own.  He remembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog-eared notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick, half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes.  There were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at 197 Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey.  If then the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more fully.  The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two
sides of London.  He was now fixed on the far east on the northern shore, on the east of the southern shore, and on the south.  The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme, let alone the City itself and the very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west.  I went back to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax. He replied, "Well guv'nor, you've treated me very 'an'some", I had given him half a sovereign, "an I'll tell yer all I know.  I heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley, as 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at Purfleet.  There ain't a many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin' that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut." I asked if he could tell me where to find him.  I told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another half sovereign to him.  So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search then and there. At the door he stopped, and said, "Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a keepin' you 'ere.  I may find Sam soon, or I mayn't, but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way to tell ye much tonight.  Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.  If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on it, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye tonight.  But ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', never mind the booze the night afore." This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change.  When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way to home.  We're on the track anyhow.  I am tired tonight, and I want to sleep.  Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale.  Her eyes look as though she had been crying.  Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others.  But it is best as it is.  It is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken.  The doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business.  I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence must rest.  I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances.  Indeed, It may not be a hard task, after all, for she herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.
2 October, evening--A long and trying and exciting day.  By the first post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on which was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand, "Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4 Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth.  Arsk for the depite." I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina.  She looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well.  I determined not to wake her, but that when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for her going back to Exeter.  I think she would be happier in our own home, with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and in ignorance.  I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and
told him where I was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything.  I drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter's Court.  Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked for Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when I had found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging house. When I asked the man who came to the door for the "depite," he shook his head, and said, "I dunno 'im.  There ain't no such a person 'ere. I never 'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days.  Don't believe there ain't nobody of that kind livin' 'ere or anywheres." I took out Smollet's letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me.  "What are you?" I asked. "I'm the depity," he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right track.  Phonetic spelling had again misled me.  A half crown tip put the deputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock that morning.  He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a "new-fangled ware'us," and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar.  It was twelve o'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at a coffee shop, where some workmen were having their dinner.  One of them suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new "cold storage" building, and as this suited the condition of a "new-fangled ware'us," I at once drove to it.  An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam.  He was sent for on my suggestion that I was willing to pay his days wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter.  He was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing.  When I had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes, "main heavy ones," with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to which he replied, "Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few door from a big white church, or somethink of the kind, not long built.  It was a dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse we tooked the bloomin' boxes from." "How did you get in if both houses were empty?" "There was the old party what engaged me a waitin' in the 'ouse at Purfleet.  He 'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller, with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn't throw a shadder." How this phrase thrilled through me!
"Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and me a puffin' an' a blowin' afore I could upend mine anyhow, an' I'm no chicken, neither." "How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?" I asked. "He was there too.  He must 'a started off and got there afore me, for when I rung of the bell he kem an' opened the door 'isself an' 'elped me carry the boxes into the 'all." "The whole nine?" I asked. "Yus, there was five in the first load an' four in the second.  It was main dry work, an' I don't so well remember 'ow I got 'ome." I interrupted him, "Were the boxes left in the hall?" "Yus, it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it." I made one more attempt to further matters.  "You didn't have any key?" "Never used no key nor nothink.  The old gent, he opened the door 'isself an' shut it again when I druv off.  I don't remember the last time, but that was the beer." "And you can't remember the number of the house?" "No, sir.  But ye needn't have no difficulty about that.  It's a 'igh 'un with a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door.  I know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to earn a copper.  The old gent give them shillin's, an' they seein' they got so much, they wanted more.  But 'e took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lot of them went away cussin'." I thought that with this description I could find the house, so having paid my friend for his information, I started off for Piccadilly.  I had gained a new painful experience.  The Count could, it was evident, handle the earth boxes himself.  If so, time was precious, for now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task unobserved.  At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked westward.  Beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula.  The house looked as though it had been long untenanted.  The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were up.  All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice board in front of the balcony.  It had, however, been roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.  Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white.  I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership of the house.  I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house.
There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and nothing could be done, so I went around to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter.  The mews were active, the Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation.  I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house.  One of them said that he heard it had lately been taken, but he couldn't say from whom.  He told me, however, that up to very lately there had been a notice board of "For Sale" up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy the house agents could tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board.  I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know or guess too much, so thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled away.  It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I did not lose any time.  Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in Sackville Street. The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but uncommunicative in equal proportion.  Having once told me that the Piccadilly house, which throughout our interview he called a "mansion," was sold, he considered my business as concluded.  When I asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and paused a few seconds before replying, "It is sold, sir." "Pardon me," I said, with equal politeness, "but I have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it." Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more.  "It is sold, sir," was again his laconic reply. "Surely," I said, "you do not mind letting me know so much." "But I do mind," he answered.  "The affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy." This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with him.  I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said, "Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence.  I am myself a professional man." Here I handed him my card.  "In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity, I act on the part of Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was, he understood, lately for sale." These words put a different complexion on affairs.  He said, "I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would I like to oblige his lordship.  We once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the honourable Arthur Holmwood.  If you will let me have his lordship's address I will consult the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his lordship by tonight's post.  It will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his lordship." I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him, gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away.  It was now dark, and I was tired and hungry.  I got a cup of tea at the Aerated Bread Company and came down to Purfleet by the next train.
I found all the others at home.  Mina was looking tired and pale, but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful.  It wrung my heart to think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquietude.  Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence.  It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her out of our grim task.  She seems somehow more reconciled, or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders.  I am glad we made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing knowledge would be torture to her. I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone, so after dinner, followed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselves, I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed. The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me as though she would detain me, but there was much to be talked of and I came away.  Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us. When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in the study.  In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information. When I had finished Van Helsing said, "This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan.  Doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes.  If we find them all in that house, then our work is near the end.  But if there be some missing, we must search until we find them. Then shall we make our final coup, and hunt the wretch to his real death." We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr. Morris spoke, "Say!  How are we going to get into that house?" "We got into the other," answered Lord Godalming quickly. "But, Art, this is different.  We broke house at Carfax, but we had night and a walled park to protect us.  It will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night.  I confess I don't see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort." Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked about the room.  By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to another of us, "Quincey's head is level.  This burglary business is getting serious.  We got off once all right, but we have now a rare job on hand.  Unless we can find the Count's key basket." As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's, we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time.  For a good while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings.  I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment.  I am very sleepy and shall go to bed . . .
Just a line.  Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular.  Her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even in her sleep.  She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she did this morning.  Tomorrow will, I hope, mend all this.  She will be herself at home in Exeter.  Oh, but I am sleepy!
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 1 October.--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield.  His moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more than interesting study.  This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.  He was, in fact, commanding destiny, subjectively.  He did not really care for any of the things of mere earth, he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked him, "What about the flies these times?" He smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way, such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio, as he answered me, "The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature.  It's wings are typical of the aerial powers of the psychic faculties.  The ancients did well when they typified the soul as a butterfly!" I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said quickly, "Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?" His madness foiled his reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him. He said, "Oh, no, oh no!  I want no souls.  Life is all I want."  Here he brightened up.  "I am pretty indifferent about it at present.  Life is all right.  I have all I want.  You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to study zoophagy!" This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on.  "Then you command life. You are a god, I suppose?" He smiled with an ineffably benign superiority.  "Oh no!  Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity.  I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings.  If I may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied spiritually!" This was a poser to me.  I could not at the moment recall Enoch's appositeness, so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic.  "And why with Enoch?" "Because he walked with God."
I could not see the analogy, but did not like to admit it, so I harked back to what he had denied.  "So you don't care about life and you don't want souls.  Why not?"  I put my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him. The effort succeeded, for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as he replied.  "I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed!  I don't. I couldn't use them if I had them.  They would be no manner of use to me.  I couldn't eat them or . . ." He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face, like a wind sweep on the surface of the water. "And doctor, as to life, what is it after all?  When you've got all you require, and you know that you will never want, that is all.  I have friends, good friends, like you, Dr. Seward."  This was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning.  "I know that I shall never lack the means of life!" I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as he, a dogged silence.  After a short time I saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him.  He was sulky, and so I came away. Later in the day he sent for me.  Ordinarily I would not have come without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him that I would gladly make an effort.  Besides, I am glad to have anything to help pass the time.  Harker is out, following up clues, and so are Lord Godalming and Quincey.  Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the Harkers.  He seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light up on some clue.  He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause.  I would have taken him with me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again.  There was also another reason.  Renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were alone. I found him sitting in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part.  When I came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his lips.  "What about souls?" It was evident then that my surmise had been correct.  Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the lunatic.  I determined to have the matter out. "What about them yourself?" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all around him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer. "I don't want any souls!" he said in a feeble, apologetic way.  The matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it, to "be cruel only to be kind."  So I said, "You like life, and you want life?"
"Oh yes!  But that is all right.  You needn't worry about that!" "But," I asked, "how are we to get the life without getting the soul also?" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up, "A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out here, with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and moaning all around you.  You've got their lives, you know, and you must put up with their souls!" Something seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes, screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped.  There was something pathetic in it that touched me.  It also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child, only a child, though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white.  It was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him, speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears, "Would you like some sugar to get your flies around again?" He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head.  With a laugh he replied, "Not much!  Flies are poor things, after all!"  After a pause he added, "But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same." "Or spiders?" I went on. "Blow spiders!  What's the use of spiders?  There isn't anything in them to eat or . . ."  He stopped suddenly as though reminded of a forbidden topic. "So, so!" I thought to myself, "this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word 'drink'.  What does it mean?" Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract my attention from it, "I don't take any stock at all in such matters.  'Rats and mice and such small deer,' as Shakespeare has it, 'chicken feed of the larder' they might be called. I'm past all that sort of nonsense.  You might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks, as to try to interest me about the less carnivora, when I know of what is before me." "I see," I said.  "You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in?  How would you like to breakfast on an elephant?" "What ridiculous nonsense you are talking?"  He was getting too wide awake, so I thought I would press him hard. "I wonder," I said reflectively, "what an elephant's soul is like!" The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his high-horse and became a child again.
"I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!" he said.  For a few moments he sat despondently.  Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. "To hell with you and your souls!" he shouted.  "Why do you plague me about souls?  Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, to distract me already, without thinking of souls?" He looked so hostile that I thought he was in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically, "Forgive me, Doctor.  I forgot myself.  You do not need any help.  I am so worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable.  If you only knew the problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and tolerate, and pardon me.  Pray do not put me in a strait waistcoat.  I want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined.  I am sure you will understand!" He had evidently self-control, so when the attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew.  Renfield watched them go.  When the door was closed he said with considerable dignity and sweetness, "Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me.  Believe me that I am very, very grateful to you!" I thought it well to leave him in this mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in this man's state. Several points seem to make what the American interviewer calls "a story," if one could only get them in proper order.  Here they are:    Will not mention "drinking."    Fears the thought of being burdened with the "soul" of anything.    Has no dread of wanting "life" in the future.    Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads    being haunted by their souls.    Logically all these things point one way!  He has assurance of    some kind that he will acquire some higher life.    He dreads the consequence, the burden of a soul.  Then it is a    human life he looks to!    And the assurance . . .? Merciful God!  The Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of terror afoot!
Later.--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my suspicion.  He grew very grave, and after thinking the matter over for a while asked me to take him to Renfield.  I did so.  As we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar
as of old.  The flies, lethargic with the autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room.  We tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend.  He went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present.  He had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a notebook.  We had to come away as ignorant as we went in. His is a curious case indeed.  We must watch him tonight.
LETTER, MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY TO LORD GODALMING. "1 October. "My Lord, "We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes.  We beg, with regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly.  The original vendors are the executors of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield.  The purchaser is a foreign nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the purchase money in notes 'over the counter,' if your Lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression.  Beyond this we know nothing whatever of him. "We are, my Lord, "Your Lordship's humble servants, "MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY."
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 2 October.--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield's room, and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me.  After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire in the study, Mrs. Harker having gone to bed, we discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day.  Harker was the only one who had any result, and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one. Before going to bed I went round to the patient's room and looked in through the observation trap.  He was sleeping soundly, his heart rose and fell with regular respiration. This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him if that was all.  He replied that it was all he heard. There was something about his manner, so suspicious that I asked him
point blank if he had been asleep.  He denied sleep, but admitted to having "dozed" for a while.  It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched. Today Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are looking after horses.  Godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose.  We must sterilize all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset.  We shall thus catch the Count at his weakest, and without a refuge to fly to.  Van Helsing is off to the British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine.  The old physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept, and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later. I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in strait waistcoats. Later.--We have met again.  We seem at last to be on the track, and our work of tomorrow may be the beginning of the end.  I wonder if Renfield's quiet has anything to do with this.  His moods have so followed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him some subtle way.  If we could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument with him today and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a valuable clue.  He is now seemingly quiet for a spell . . . Is he?  That wild yell seemed to come from his room . . . The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had somehow met with some accident.  He had heard him yell, and when he went to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.  I must go at once . . .
CHAPTER 21
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 3 October.--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well as I can remember, since last I made an entry.  Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten.  In all calmness I must proceed. When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood.  When I went to move him, it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries. There seemed none of the unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity.  As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the floor.  Indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over, "I think, sir, his back is broken.  See, both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed."  How such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure.  He
seemed quite bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said, "I can't understand the two things.  He could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor.  I saw a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her.  And I suppose he might have broken his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink.  But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things occurred.  If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head, and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it." I said to him, "Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once.  I want him without an instant's delay." The man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared.  When he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and then turned to me.  I think he recognized my thought in my eyes, for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant, "Ah, a sad accident!  He will need very careful watching, and much attention.  I shall stay with you myself, but I shall first dress myself.  If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you." The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case.  He had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up, for almost before he looked at the patient, he whispered to me, "Send the attendant away.  We must be alone with him when he becomes conscious, after the operation." I said, "I think that will do now, Simmons.  We have done all that we can at present.  You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.  Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere." The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.  The wounds of the face were superficial.  The real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The Professor thought a moment and said, "We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can be.  The rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury.  The whole motor area seems affected.  The suffusion of the brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be too late." As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door.  I went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers; the former spoke, "I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.  So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep.  Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times.  I've been thinking that tomorrow night will not see things as they have been.  We'll have to look back, and forward a little more than we have done.  May we come in?" I nodded, and held the door open till they had entered, then I closed
it again.  When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the floor, he said softly, "My God!  What has happened to him?  Poor, poor devil!" I told him briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operation, for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him.  We all watched in patience. "We shall wait," said Van Helsing, "just long enough to fix the best spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot, for it is evident that the haemorrhage is increasing." The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness.  I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come.  I dreaded the words Renfield might speak.  I was positively afraid to think.  But the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men who have heard the death watch.  The poor man's breathing came in uncertain gasps.  Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak, but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility.  Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this suspense grew and grew upon me.  I could almost hear the beating of my own heart, and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer.  The silence finally became agonizing.  I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture.  There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it. At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast.  He might die at any moment.  I looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine.  His face was sternly set as he spoke, "There is no time to lose.  His words may be worth many lives.  I have been thinking so, as I stood here.  It may be there is a soul at stake!  We shall operate just above the ear." Without another word he made the operation.  For a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous.  Then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest. Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This was continued for a few moments, then it was softened into a glad surprise, and from his lips came a sigh of relief.  He moved convulsively, and as he did so, said, "I'll be quiet, Doctor.  Tell them to take off the strait waistcoat.  I have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot move.  What's wrong with my face?  It feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully." He tried to turn his head, but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back.  Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave tone, "Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield." As he heard the voice his face brightened, through its mutilation, and he said, "That is Dr. Van Helsing.  How good it is of you to be here. Give me some water, my lips are dry, and I shall try to tell you.  I dreamed . . ."
He stopped and seemed fainting.  I called quietly to Quincey, "The brandy, it is in my study, quick!"  He flew and returned with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water.  We moistened the parched lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval, for when he was quite conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonized confusion which I shall never forget, and said, "I must not deceive myself.  It was no dream, but all a grim reality."  Then his eyes roved round the room.  As they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on, "If I were not sure already, I would know from them." For an instant his eyes closed, not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear. When he opened them he said, hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed, "Quick, Doctor, quick, I am dying!  I feel that I have but a few minutes, and then I must go back to death, or worse! Wet my lips with brandy again.  I have something that I must say before I die.  Or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow.  Thank you!  It was that night after you left me, when I implored you to let me go away.  I couldn't speak then, for I felt my tongue was tied. But I was as sane then, except in that way, as I am now.  I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me, it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me.  My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realized where I was.  I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!" As he spoke, Van Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard.  He did not, however, betray himself.  He nodded slightly and said, "Go on," in a low voice. Renfield proceeded.  "He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before, but he was solid then, not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a man's when angry.  He was laughing with his red mouth, the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking.  I wouldn't ask him to come in at first, though I knew he wanted to, just as he had wanted all along.  Then he began promising me things, not in words but by doing them." He was interrupted by a word from the Professor, "How?" "By making them happen.  Just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining.  Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings.  And big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their backs." Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously, "The Acherontia Atropos of the Sphinges, what you call the 'Death's-head Moth'?" The patient went on without stopping, "Then he began to whisper.  'Rats, rats, rats!  Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, and every one a life.  And dogs to eat them, and cats too.  All lives!  All red blood, with years of life in it, and not merely buzzing flies!'  I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.  Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house.  He beckoned me to the window.  I
got up and looked out, and He raised his hands, and seemed to call out without using any words.  A dark mass spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire.  And then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red, like His only smaller.  He held up his hand, and they all stopped, and I thought he seemed to be saying, 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!'  And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes, and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening the sash and saying to Him, 'Come in, Lord and Master!'  The rats were all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only open an inch wide, just as the Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour." His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and he continued, but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced.  I was about to call him back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me, "Let him go on.  Do not interrupt him.  He cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought." He proceeded, "All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not even a blowfly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.  When he did slide in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even knock, I got mad with him.  He sneered at me, and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was no one.  He didn't even smell the same as he went by me.  I couldn't hold him.  I thought that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had come into the room." The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better. They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered.  His face, however, grew grimmer and sterner still.  Renfield went on without noticing, "When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same.  It was like tea after the teapot has been watered."  Here we all moved, but no one said a word. He went on, "I didn't know that she was here till she spoke, and she didn't look the same.  I don't care for the pale people.  I like them with lots of blood in them, and hers all seemed to have run out.  I didn't think of it at the time, but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her."  I could feel that the rest quivered, as I did; but we remained otherwise still.  "So when He came tonight I was ready for Him.  I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight.  I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength.  And as I knew I was a madman, at times anyhow, I resolved to use my power.  Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle with me.  I held tight, and I thought I was going to win, for I didn't mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes.  They burned into me, and my strength became like water.  He slipped through it, and when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down.  There was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed to steal away under the door."
His voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous.  Van Helsing stood up instinctively. "We know the worst now," he said.  "He is here, and we know his purpose.  It may not be too late.  Let us be armed, the same as we were the other night, but lose no time, there is not an instant to spare." There was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words, we shared them in common.  We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the Count's house.  The Professor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said, "They never leave me, and they shall not till this unhappy business is over.  Be wise also, my friends.  It is no common enemy that we deal with Alas!  Alas!  That dear Madam Mina should suffer!"  He stopped, his voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart. Outside the Harkers' door we paused.  Art and Quincey held back, and the latter said, "Should we disturb her?" "We must," said Van Helsing grimly.  "If the door be locked, I shall break it in." "May it not frighten her terribly?  It is unusual to break into a lady's room!" Van Helsing said solemnly, "You are always right.  But this is life and death.  All chambers are alike to the doctor.  And even were they not they are all as one to me tonight.  Friend John, when I turn the handle, if the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you too, my friends.  Now!" He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield.  We threw ourselves against it.  With a crash it burst open, and we almost fell headlong into the room.  The Professor did actually fall, and I saw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees.  What I saw appalled me.  I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck, and my heart seemed to stand still. The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see.  On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.  Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad figure of his wife.  By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.  His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognized the Count, in every way, even to the scar on his forehead.  With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms at full tension.  His right hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom.  Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare chest which was shown by his torn-open dress.  The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it.  His eyes flamed red with devilish passion.  The great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge, and the white
sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood dripping mouth, clamped together like those of a wild beast.  With a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us.  But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back.  Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced.  The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky.  And when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour.  This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position.  Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day.  For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray.  Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin.  From her throat trickled a thin stream of blood.  Her eyes were mad with terror.  Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief.  Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me, "Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce.  We can do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers herself.  I must wake him!" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heart breaking to hear.  I raised the blind, and looked out of the window.  There was much moonshine, and as I looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew tree.  It puzzled me to think why he was doing this.  But at the instant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness, and turned to the bed.  On his face, as there might well be, was a look of wild amazement.  He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him.  Instantly, however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook. "In God's name what does this mean?" Harker cried out.  "Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it?  What has happened?  What is wrong?  Mina, dear what is it?  What does that blood mean?  My God, my God!  Has it come to this!"  And, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly together.  "Good God help us!  Help her!  Oh, help her!" With a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes, all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. "What has happened?  Tell me all about it!" he cried without pausing. "Dr. Van Helsing, you love Mina, I know.  Oh, do something to save her.
It cannot have gone too far yet.  Guard her while I look for him!" His wife, through her terror and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him.  Instantly forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out. "No!  No!  Jonathan, you must not leave me.  I have suffered enough tonight, God knows, without the dread of his harming you.  You must stay with me.  Stay with these friends who will watch over you!"  Her expression became frantic as she spoke.  And, he yielding to her, she pulled him down sitting on the bedside, and clung to him fiercely. Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both.  The Professor held up his golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness, "Do not fear, my dear.  We are here, and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach.  You are safe for tonight, and we must be calm and take counsel together." She shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on her husband's breast.  When she raised it, his white nightrobe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where the thin open wound in the neck had sent forth drops.  The instant she saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking sobs. "Unclean, unclean!  I must touch him or kiss him no more.  Oh, that it should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have most cause to fear." To this he spoke out resolutely, "Nonsense, Mina.  It is a shame to me to hear such a word.  I would not hear it of you.  And I shall not hear it from you.  May God judge me by my deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour, if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!" He put out his arms and folded her to his breast.  And for a while she lay there sobbing.  He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils.  His mouth was set as steel. After a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost. "And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it.  Too well I know the broad fact.  Tell me all that has been." I told him exactly what had happened and he listened with seeming impassiveness, but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to see that whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair.  Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.  They entered in obedience to our summons.  Van Helsing looked at me questioningly.  I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves.  So on nodding acquiescence to him he
asked them what they had seen or done.  To which Lord Godalming answered. "I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone.  He had, however . . ."  He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed. Van Helsing said gravely, "Go on, friend Arthur.  We want here no more concealments.  Our hope now is in knowing all.  Tell freely!" So Art went on, "He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few seconds, he made rare hay of the place.  All the manuscript had been burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes.  The cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax had helped the flames." Here I interrupted.  "Thank God there is the other copy in the safe!" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on.  "I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him.  I looked into Renfield's room, but there was no trace there except . . ."  Again he paused. "Go on," said Harker hoarsely.  So he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue, added, "except that the poor fellow is dead." Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly, "God's will be done!" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back something.  But, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing. Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked, "And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?" "A little," he answered.  "It may be much eventually, but at present I can't say.  I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would go when he left the house.  I did not see him, but I saw a bat rise from Renfield's window, and flap westward.  I expected to see him in some shape go back to Carfax, but he evidently sought some other lair.  He will not be back tonight, for the sky is reddening in the east, and the dawn is close.  We must work tomorrow!" He said the latter words through his shut teeth.  For a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could hear the sound of our hearts beating. Then Van Helsing said, placing his hand tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head, "And now, Madam Mina, poor dear, dear, Madam Mina, tell us exactly what happened.  God knows that I do not want that you be pained, but it is need that we know all.  For now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest.  The day is close to us that must end all, if it may be so, and now is the chance that we may live and learn." The poor dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and
lower still on his breast.  Then she raised her head proudly, and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and after stooping and kissing it reverently, held it fast.  The other hand was locked in that of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.  After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she began. "I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a long time it did not act.  I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind.  All of them connected with death, and vampires, with blood, and pain, and trouble."  Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly, "Do not fret, dear.  You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task.  If you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I need your help.  Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to sleep.  Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more.  Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember.  There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed.  But I forget now if you know of this.  You will find it in my diary which I shall show you later.  I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.  I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I.  I tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified.  Then indeed, my heart sank within me.  Beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist, or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared, stood a tall, thin man, all in black.  I knew him at once from the description of the others.  The waxen face, the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line, the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between, and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby.  I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him.  For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was paralyzed.  In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he spoke to Jonathan. "'Silence!  If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes.'  I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything.  With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did so, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well be quiet.  It is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have appeased my thirst!'  I was bewildered, and strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him.  I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is, when his touch is on his victim.  And oh, my God, my God, pity me!  He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!"  Her husband groaned again.  She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if he were the injured one, and went on. "I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon.  How long this horrible thing lasted I know not, but it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I saw it drip with the fresh blood!"  The remembrance seemed for a while
to overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her husband's sustaining arm.  With a great effort she recovered herself and went on. "Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would play your brains against mine.  You would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my design!  You know now, and they know in part already, and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path.  They should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they played wits against me, against me who commanded nations, and intrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were born, I was countermining them.  And you, their best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, kin of my kin, my bountiful wine-press for a while, and shall be later on my companion and my helper.  You shall be avenged in turn, for not one of them but shall minister to your needs.  But as yet you are to be punished for what you have done.  You have aided in thwarting me.  Now you shall come to my call.  When my brain says "Come!" to you, you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding.  And to that end this!' "With that he pulled open his shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast.  When the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some to the . . . Oh, my God!  My God! What have I done?  What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days.  God pity me!  Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril.  And in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!"  Then she began to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution. As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken, and everything became more and more clear.  Harker was still and quiet; but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out against the whitening hair. We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action. Of this I am sure.  The sun rises today on no more miserable house in all the great round of its daily course.
CHAPTER 22
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 3 October.--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary.  It is now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat, for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best.  Our best will be, God knows, required today.  I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare not stop to think.  All, big and little, must go down.
Perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most.  The teaching, big or little, could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are today.  However, we must trust and hope.  Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is tested.  That we must keep on trusting, and that God will aid us up to the end.  The end!  Oh my God!  What end? . . . To work!  To work! When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done.  First, Dr. Seward told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap.  His face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken. Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything.  He said that he had been sitting down, he confessed to half dozing, when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield had called out loudly several times, "God!  God!  God!" After that there was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him.  Van Helsing asked if he had heard "voices" or "a voice," and he said he could not say.  That at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one.  He could swear to it, if required, that the word "God" was spoken by the patient. Dr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into the matter.  The question of an inquest had to be considered, and it would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it.  As it was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed.  In case the coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily to the same result. When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full confidence.  That nothing of any sort, no matter how painful, should be kept from her.  She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of despair. "There must be no concealment," she said.  "Alas!  We have had too much already.  And besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than I have already endured, than I suffer now! Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!" Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly but quietly, "But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid.  Not for yourself, but for others from yourself, after what has happened?" Her face grew set in its lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she answered, "Ah no!  For my mind is made up!" "To what?" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still, for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer came with direct simplicity, as though she was simply
stating a fact, "Because if I find in myself, and I shall watch keenly for it, a sign of harm to any that I love, I shall die!" "You would not kill yourself?" he asked, hoarsely. "I would.  If there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a pain, and so desperate an effort!"  She looked at him meaningly as she spoke. He was sitting down, but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly.  "My child, there is such an one if it were for your good.  For myself I could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you, even at this moment if it were best.  Nay, were it safe!  But my child . . ." For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his throat.  He gulped it down and went on, "There are here some who would stand between you and death.  You must not die.  You must not die by any hand, but least of all your own.  Until the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not die.  For if he is still with the quick Undead, your death would make you even as he is.  No, you must live!  You must struggle and strive to live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable.  You must fight Death himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy.  By the day, or the night, in safety or in peril!  On your living soul I charge you that you do not die.  Nay, nor think of death, till this great evil be past." The poor dear grew white as death, and shook and shivered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide.  We were all silent.  We could do nothing.  At length she grew more calm and turning to him said sweetly, but oh so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand, "I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall strive to do so.  Till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may have passed away from me." She was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we began to discuss what we were to do.  I told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use, and was to keep the record as she had done before.  She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do, if "pleased" could be used in connection with so grim an interest. As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work. "It is perhaps well," he said, "that at our meeting after our visit to Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth boxes that lay there.  Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others.  But now he does not know our intentions.  Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilize his lairs, so that he cannot use them as of old. "We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them.  Today then, is ours, and in it rests our
hope.  The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course.  Until it sets tonight, that monster must retain whatever form he now has.  He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope.  He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies.  If he go through a doorway, he must open the door like a mortal.  And so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilize them.  So we shall, if we have not yet catch him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure." Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us, since whilst we talked action was impossible.  But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly. "Nay, friend Jonathan," he said, "in this, the quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say.  We shall all act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come.  But think, in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.  The Count may have many houses which he has bought.  Of them he will have deeds of purchase, keys and other things.  He will have paper that he write on.  He will have his book of cheques.  There are many belongings that he must have somewhere.  Why not in this place so central, so quiet, where he come and go by the front or the back at all hours, when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice.  We shall go there and search that house.  And when we learn what it holds, then we do what our friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so we run down our old fox, so?  Is it not?" "Then let us come at once," I cried, "we are wasting the precious, precious time!" The Professor did not move, but simply said, "And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?" "Any way!" I cried.  "We shall break in if need be." "And your police?  Where will they be, and what will they say?" I was staggered, but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason for it.  So I said, as quietly as I could, "Don't wait more than need be.  You know, I am sure, what torture I am in." "Ah, my child, that I do.  And indeed there is no wish of me to add to your anguish.  But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at movement.  Then will come our time.  I have thought and thought, and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all.  Now we wish to get into the house, but we have no key.  Is it not so?"  I nodded. "Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could not still get in.  And think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do?" "I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the lock for me." "And your police, they would interfere, would they not?"
"Oh no!  Not if they knew the man was properly employed." "Then," he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, "all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to whether or not that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever, oh so clever, in reading the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter.  No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty houses in this your London, or of any city in the world, and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere.  I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar come and broke window at back and got in.  Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police.  Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice.  And when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them.  Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time.  And your police and other authority help him all they can.  And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been.  This was all done en regle, and in our work we shall be en regle too.  We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem it strange.  But we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house." I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina's face became relaxed in thought.  There was hope in such good counsel. Van Helsing went on, "When once within that house we may find more clues.  At any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be more earth boxes, at Bermondsey and Mile End." Lord Godalming stood up.  "I can be of some use here," he said.  "I shall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most convenient." "Look here, old fellow," said Morris, "it is a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horse backing, but don't you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purpose?  It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east.  And even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to." "Friend Quincey is right!" said the Professor.  "His head is what you call in plane with the horizon.  It is a difficult thing that we go to do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may." Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night.  She was very, very pale, almost ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth
in somewhat of prominence.  I did not mention this last, lest it should give her needless pain, but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood.  As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper, but the time as yet was short, and there was time for fear. When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt.  It was finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the Count's lair close at hand.  In case he should find it out too soon, we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction.  And his presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us some new clue. As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that, after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly.  That the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.  It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there.  At any rate, we might be able to follow him in force.  To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina.  I thought that my mind was made up on the subject, but Mina would not listen to my objection.  She said that there might be some law matter in which I could be useful. That amongst the Count's papers might be some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania.  And that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the Count's extraordinary power.  I had to give in, for Mina's resolution was fixed.  She said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together. "As for me," she said, "I have no fear.  Things have been as bad as they can be.  And whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort.  Go, my husband!  God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present." So I started up crying out, "Then in God's name let us come at once, for we are losing time.  The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we think." "Not so!" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand. "But why?" I asked. "Do you forget," he said, with actually a smile, "that last night he banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?" Did I forget!  Shall I ever . . . can I ever!  Can any of us ever forget that terrible scene!  Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance, but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and shuddered whilst she moaned.  Van Helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience.  He had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her.
"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, "dear, dear, Madam Mina, alas!  That I of all who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful.  These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so, but you will forget it, will you not?"  He bent low beside her as he spoke. She took his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely, "No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember. And with it I have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all together.  Now, you must all be going soon.  Breakfast is ready, and we must all eat that we may be strong." Breakfast was a strange meal to us all.  We tried to be cheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us.  When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said, "Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise.  Are we all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's lair.  Armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?" We all assured him. "Then it is well.  Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case quite safe here until the sunset.  And before then we shall return . . . if . . . We shall return!  But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack.  I have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know, so that He may not enter.  Now let me guard yourself.  On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the name of the Father, the Son, and . . ." There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear.  As he had placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, it had seared it . . . had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor darling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain of it, and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the words to her thought came quickly.  The echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement.  Pulling her beautiful hair over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out. "Unclean!  Unclean!  Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh!  I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgement Day." They all paused.  I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief, and putting my arms around held her tight.  For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently.  Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely.  So gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself. "It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgement Day, to redress all
wrongs of the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away, and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us.  Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will.  It may be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other through stripes and shame.  Through tears and blood.  Through doubts and fear, and all that makes the difference between God and man." There was hope in his words, and comfort.  And they made for resignation.  Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old man's hands and bent over and kissed it.  Then without a word we all knelt down together, and all holding hands, swore to be true to each other.  We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved.  And we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.  It was then time to start.  So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which neither of us shall forget to our dying day, and we set out. To one thing I have made up my mind.  If we find out that Mina must be a vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone.  I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many.  Just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks. We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion.  It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew.  Had not our minds been made up, and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded with our task.  We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house.  And in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last. Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before him, "And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do.  We must sterilize this earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use.  He has chosen this earth because it has been holy.  Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more holy still.  It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to God." As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open.  The earth smelled musty and close, but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the Professor.  Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked. One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left them as we had found them to all appearance.  But in each was a portion of the Host.  When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly, "So much is already done.  It may be that with all the
others we can be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine of Madam Mina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!" As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum.  I looked eagerly, and in the window of my own room saw Mina.  I waved my hand to her, and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished.  She nodded in reply to show that she understood.  The last I saw, she was waving her hand in farewell.  It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the platform.  I have written this in the train.
Piccadilly, 12:30 o'clock.--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street Lord Godalming said to me, "Quincey and I will find a locksmith.  You had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty. For under the circumstances it wouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an empty house.  But you are a solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you should have known better." I demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium, but he went on, "Besides, it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us.  My title will make it all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along.  You had better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park.  Somewhere in sight of the house, and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do you all come across.  We shall be on the lookout for you, and shall let you in." "The advice is good!" said Van Helsing, so we said no more.  Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another.  At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green Park.  My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours.  We sat down on a bench within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible.  The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others. At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up.  Out of it, in leisurely fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris.  And down from the box descended a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away.  Together the two ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.  The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along.  The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him.  After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools which he proceeded to lay beside him in orderly fashion.  Then he stood up, looked in the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to his employers, made some remark.  Lord Godalming smiled, and the man lifted a good sized bunch of keys. Selecting one of them, he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it.  After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third.  All at once the door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others entered the hall.  We sat still.  My own cigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsing's went cold altogether.  We waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring his bag.
Then he held the door partly open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.  This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and gave him something.  The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and departed.  Not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction. When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at the door.  It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood Lord Godalming lighting a cigar. "The place smells so vilely," said the latter as we came in.  It did indeed smell vilely.  Like the old chapel at Carfax.  And with our previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the place pretty freely.  We moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of attack, for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the house. In the dining room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth.  Eight boxes only out of the nine which we sought! Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stone flagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to look like the front of a miniature house.  There were no windows in it, so we were not afraid of being overlooked.  We did not lose any time in examining the chests.  With the tools which we had brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel.  It was evident to us that the Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of his effects. After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the dining room contained any effects which might belong to the Count.  And so we proceeded to minutely examine them.  They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining room table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle, deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey, notepaper, envelopes, and pens and ink.  All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust.  There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin.  The latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood.  Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places.  The rest of us are, with what patience we can, waiting their return, or the coming of the Count.
CHAPTER 23
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 3 October.--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris.  The Professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time.  I could see his beneficent purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.  The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.  Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. Today he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief-written lines of his face.  His energy is still intact.  In fact, he is like a living flame.  This may yet be his salvation, for if all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period.  He will then, in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life.  Poor fellow, I thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his . . . ! The Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active.  What he has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest.  So well as I can remember, here it is: "I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all the papers relating to this monster, and the more I have studied, the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out.  All through there are signs of his advance.  Not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it.  As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminius of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man.  Soldier, statesman, and alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the science knowledge of his time.  He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse.  He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay. "Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death.  Though it would seem that memory was not all complete.  In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child.  But he is growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of man's stature.  He is experimenting, and doing it well.  And if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet, he may be yet if we fail, the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead through Death, not Life." Harker groaned and said, "And this is all arrayed against my darling! But how is he experimenting?  The knowledge may help us to defeat him!" "He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but surely.  That big child-brain of his is working.  Well for us, it is as yet a child-brain.  For had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power.  However, he means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow.  Festina lente may well be his motto." "I fail to understand," said Harker wearily.  "Oh, do be more plain to
me!  Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain." The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke, "Ah, my child, I will be plain.  Do you not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally.  How he has been making use of the zoophagous patient to effect his entry into friend John's home.  For your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate.  But these are not his most important experiments.  Do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others.  He knew not then but that must be so.  But all the time that so great child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box.  So he began to help.  And then, when he found that this be all right, he try to move them all alone.  And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him.  And none but he know where they are hidden. "He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground.  So that only he use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his form, they do him equal well, and none may know these are his hiding place!  But, my child, do not despair, this knowledge came to him just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilize as for him.  And before the sunset this shall be so.  Then he have no place where he can move and hide.  I delayed this morning that so we might be sure.  Is there not more at stake for us than for him?  Then why not be more careful than him?  By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us.  Today is our day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance.  See!  There are five of us when those absent ones return." Whilst we were speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the double postman's knock of the telegraph boy.  We all moved out to the hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it.  The boy handed in a dispatch.  The Professor closed the door again, and after looking at the direction, opened it and read aloud. "Look out for D.  He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South.  He seems to be going the round and may want to see you:  Mina." There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice, "Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!" Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said, "God will act in His own way and time.  Do not fear, and do not rejoice as yet.  For what we wish for at the moment may be our own undoings." "I care for nothing now," he answered hotly, "except to wipe out this brute from the face of creation.  I would sell my soul to do it!" "Oh, hush, hush, my child!" said Van Helsing.  "God does not purchase souls in this wise, and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep faith.  But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear Madam Mina.  Think you, how her pain would be doubled, did she but hear your wild words.  Do not fear any of us, we are all devoted to this cause, and today shall see the end.  The time is coming for action.  Today this Vampire is limit to the powers
of man, and till sunset he may not change.  It will take him time to arrive here, see it is twenty minutes past one, and there are yet some times before he can hither come, be he never so quick.  What we must hope for is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first." About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's telegram, there came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door.  It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made the Professor's heart and mine beat loudly.  We looked at each other, and together moved out into the hall.  We each held ready to use our various armaments, the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right.  Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and holding the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for action.  The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the hall: "It is all right.  We found both places.  Six boxes in each and we destroyed them all." "Destroyed?" asked the Professor. "For him!"  We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said, "There's nothing to do but to wait here.  If, however, he doesn't turn up by five o'clock, we must start off.  For it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker alone after sunset." "He will be here before long now," said Van Helsing, who had been consulting his pocketbook.  "Nota bene, in Madam's telegram he went south from Carfax.  That means he went to cross the river, and he could only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one o'clock.  That he went south has a meaning for us.  He is as yet only suspicious, and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least.  You must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him.  That he is not here already shows that he went to Mile End next.  This took him some time, for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way.  Believe me, my friends, we shall not have long to wait now.  We should have ready some plan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance.  Hush, there is no time now.  Have all your arms!  Be ready!"  He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door. I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself.  In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly.  Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively.  With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position.  Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door. Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window.  We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness.  The slow, careful steps came along the hall.  The Count was evidently prepared for some surprise,
at least he feared it. Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room.  Winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him.  There was something so pantherlike in the movement, something so unhuman, that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming.  The first to act was Harker, who with a quick movement, threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house.  As the Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eyeteeth long and pointed.  But the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lion-like disdain.  His expression again changed as, with a single impulse, we all advanced upon him.  It was a pity that we had not some better organized plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do.  I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him.  The blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count's leap back saved him.  A second less and the trenchant blade had shorn through his heart.  As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank notes and a stream of gold fell out.  The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for a moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke.  Instinctively I moved forward with a protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand.  I felt a mighty power fly along my arm, and it was without surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us.  It would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity, of anger and hellish rage, which came over the Count's face.  His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous dive he swept under Harker's arm, ere his blow could fall, and grasping a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw himself at the window.  Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass, he tumbled into the flagged area below.  Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hear the "ting" of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging. We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground.  He, rushing up the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door. There he turned and spoke to us. "You think to baffle me, you with your pale faces all in a row, like sheep in a butcher's.  You shall be sorry yet, each one of you!  You think you have left me without a place to rest, but I have more.  My revenge is just begun!  I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side.  Your girls that you all love are mine already.  And through them you and others shall yet be mine, my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed.  Bah!" With a contemptuous sneer, he passed quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him.  A door beyond opened and shut.  The first of us to speak was the Professor. Realizing the difficulty of following him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.
"We have learnt something . . . much!  Notwithstanding his brave words, he fears us.  He fears time, he fears want!  For if not, why he hurry so?  His very tone betray him, or my ears deceive.  Why take that money?  You follow quick.  You are hunters of the wild beast, and understand it so.  For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he returns." As he spoke he put the money remaining in his pocket, took the title deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with a match. Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had lowered himself from the window to follow the Count.  He had, however, bolted the stable door, and by the time they had forced it open there was no sign of him.  Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back of the house.  But the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart. It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off.  We had to recognize that our game was up.  With heavy hearts we agreed with the Professor when he said, "Let us go back to Madam Mina.  Poor, poor dear Madam Mina.  All we can do just now is done, and we can there, at least, protect her.  But we need not despair.  There is but one more earth box, and we must try to find it.  When that is done all may yet be well." I could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken down, now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress.  He was thinking of his wife. With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness.  When she saw our faces, her own became as pale as death.  For a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret prayer. And then she said cheerfully, "I can never thank you all enough.  Oh, my poor darling!" As she spoke, she took her husband's grey head in her hands and kissed it. "Lay your poor head here and rest it.  All will yet be well, dear!  God will protect us if He so will it in His good intent."  The poor fellow groaned.  There was no place for words in his sublime misery. We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us all up somewhat.  It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry people, for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast, or the sense of companionship may have helped us, but anyhow we were all less miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed. And although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness.  When we came to the part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung
to her husband's arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come.  She said nothing, however, till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought up to the present time. Then without letting go her husband's hand she stood up amongst us and spoke.  Oh, that I could give any idea of the scene.  Of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our teeth, remembering whence and how it came.  Her loving kindness against our grim hate. Her tender faith against all our fears and doubting.  And we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and purity and faith, was outcast from God. "Jonathan," she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness, "Jonathan dear, and you all my true, true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this dreadful time.  I know that you must fight.  That you must destroy even as you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter.  But it is not a work of hate.  That poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all.  Just think what will be his joy when he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have spiritual immortality.  You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may not hold your hands from his destruction." As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and draw together, as though the passion in him were shriveling his being to its core. Instinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer, till his knuckles looked white.  She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing his hand from hers as he spoke. "May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at.  If beyond it I could send his soul forever and ever to burning hell I would do it!" "Oh, hush!  Oh, hush in the name of the good God.  Don't say such things, Jonathan, my husband, or you will crush me with fear and horror.  Just think, my dear . . . I have been thinking all this long, long day of it . . . that . . . perhaps . . . some day . . . I, too, may need such pity, and that some other like you, and with equal cause for anger, may deny it to me!  Oh, my husband!  My husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought had there been another way.  But I pray that God may not have treasured your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man.  Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom so many sorrows have come." We men were all in tears now.  There was no resisting them, and we wept openly.  She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.  Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress.
Van Helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone with their God. Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace. She tried to school herself to the belief, and manifestly for her husband's sake, tried to seem content.  It was a brave struggle, and was, I think and believe, not without its reward.  Van Helsing had placed at hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.  When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady.  The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in, for his is the second watch.  Now that my work is done I, too, shall go to bed.
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 3-4 October, close to midnight.--I thought yesterday would never end. There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must now be for the better.  Before we parted, we discussed what our next step was to be, but we could arrive at no result.  All we knew was that one earth box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was.  If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years.  And in the meantime, the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.  This I know, that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that one is my poor wronged darling.  I loved her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable.  Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature.  This is hope to me.  We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor.  Thank God!  Mina is sleeping, and sleeping without dreams.  I fear what her dreams might be like, with such terrible memories to ground them in.  She has not been so calm, within my seeing, since the sunset.  Then, for a while, there came over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.  I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning.  I am not sleepy myself, though I am weary . . . weary to death.  However, I must try to sleep.  For there is tomorrow to think of, and there is no rest for me until . . .
Later--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awakened by Mina, who was sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face.  I could see easily, for we did not leave the room in darkness.  She had placed a warning hand over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear, "Hush! There is someone in the corridor!"  I got up softly, and crossing the room, gently opened the door. Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake.  He raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me, "Hush!  Go back to bed.  It is all right.  One of us will be here all night.  We don't mean to take any chances!"
His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina. She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale face as she put her arms round me and said softly, "Oh, thank God for good brave men!"  With a sigh she sank back again to sleep.  I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.
4 October, morning.--Once again during the night I was wakened by Mina.  This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly, "Go, call the Professor.  I want to see him at once." "Why?" I asked. "I have an idea.  I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured without my knowing it.  He must hypnotize me before the dawn, and then I shall be able to speak.  Go quick, dearest, the time is getting close." I went to the door.  Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and seeing me, he sprang to his feet. "Is anything wrong?" he asked, in alarm. "No," I replied.  "But Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once." "I will go," he said, and hurried into the Professor's room. Two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his dressing gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at the door asking questions.  When the Professor saw Mina a smile, a positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face. He rubbed his hands as he said, "Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change.  See!  Friend Jonathan, we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us today!"  Then turning to her, he said cheerfully, "And what am I to do for you?  For at this hour you do not want me for nothing." "I want you to hypnotize me!" she said.  "Do it before the dawn, for I feel that then I can speak, and speak freely.  Be quick, for the time is short!"  Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed. Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her, from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn.  Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still.  Only by the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive.  The Professor made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration.  Mina opened her eyes, but she did not seem the same woman.  There was a far-away look in her eyes, and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me.  Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professor
motioned to me to bring the others in.  They came on tiptoe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them.  The stillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the current of her thoughts. "Where are you?"  The answer came in a neutral way. "I do not know.  Sleep has no place it can call its own."  For several minutes there was silence.  Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood staring at her fixedly. The rest of us hardly dared to breathe.  The room was growing lighter. Without taking his eyes from Mina's face, Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind.  I did so, and the day seemed just upon us.  A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room.  On the instant the Professor spoke again. "Where are you now?" The answer came dreamily, but with intention.  It were as though she were interpreting something.  I have heard her use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes. "I do not know.  It is all strange to me!" "What do you see?" "I can see nothing.  It is all dark." "What do you hear?"  I could detect the strain in the Professor's patient voice. "The lapping of water.  It is gurgling by, and little waves leap.  I can hear them on the outside." "Then you are on a ship?'" We all looked at each other, trying to glean something each from the other.  We were afraid to think. The answer came quick, "Oh, yes!" "What else do you hear?" "The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about.  There is the creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan falls into the ratchet." "What are you doing?" "I am still, oh so still.  It is like death!"  The voice faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again. By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of day.  Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders, and laid her head down softly on her pillow.  She lay like a sleeping child for a few moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder
to see us all around her. "Have I been talking in my sleep?" was all she said.  She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she was eager to know what she had told.  The Professor repeated the conversation, and she said, "Then there is not a moment to lose.  It may not be yet too late!" Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor's calm voice called them back. "Stay, my friends.  That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor at the moment in your so great Port of London.  Which of them is it that you seek?  God be thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we know not.  We have been blind somewhat. Blind after the manner of men, since we can look back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen!  Alas, but that sentence is a puddle, is it not?  We can know now what was in the Count's mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread.  He meant escape.  Hear me, ESCAPE!  He saw that with but one earth box left, and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him.  He have take his last earth box on board a ship, and he leave the land.  He think to escape, but no!  We follow him.  Tally Ho!  As friend Arthur would say when he put on his red frock!  Our old fox is wily.  Oh!  So wily, and we must follow with wile.  I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he would.  Unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is us.  Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need, and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with us." Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked, "But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?" He took her hand and patted it as he replied, "Ask me nothing as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all questions."  He would say no more, and we separated to dress. After breakfast Mina repeated her question.  He looked at her gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully, "Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!" She grew paler as she asked faintly, "Why?" "Because," he answered solemnly, "he can live for centuries, and you are but mortal woman.  Time is now to be dreaded, since once he put that mark upon your throat." I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.
CHAPTER 24
DR. SEWARD'S PHONOGRAPH DIARY SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING This to Jonathan Harker. You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina.  We shall go to make our search, if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we seek confirmation only.  But do you stay and take care of her today. This is your best and most holiest office.  This day nothing can find him here. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already, for I have tell them.  He, our enemy, have gone away.  He have gone back to his Castle in Transylvania.  I know it so well, as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall.  He have prepare for this in some way, and that last earth box was ready to ship somewheres.  For this he took the money.  For this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun go down.  It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.  But there was not of time.  When that fail he make straight for his last resource, his last earth-work I might say did I wish double entente.  He is clever, oh so clever!  He know that his game here was finish.  And so he decide he go back home.  He find ship going by the route he came, and he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound.  When we have discover that, we come back and tell you all.  Then we will comfort you and poor Madam Mina with new hope.  For it will be hope when you think it over, that all is not lost.  This very creature that we pursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London.  And yet in one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out.  He is finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.  But we are strong, each in our purpose, and we are all more strong together.  Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina.  This battle is but begun and in the end we shall win.  So sure as that God sits on high to watch over His children.  Therefore be of much comfort till we return. VAN HELSING.
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 4 October.--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing's message in the phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably.  Already the certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort. And comfort is strength to her.  For my own part, now that his horrible danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to believe in it.  Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem like a long forgotten dream.  Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright sunlight.
Alas!  How can I disbelieve!  In the midst of my thought my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darling's white forehead.  Whilst that lasts, there can be no disbelief.  Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been over all the diaries again and again.  Somehow, although the reality seem greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less.  There is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.  Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good.  It may be!  I shall try to think as she does.  We have never spoken to each other yet of the future.  It is better to wait till we see the Professor and the others after their investigations. The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run for me again.  It is now three o'clock.
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 5 October, 5 P.M.--Our meeting for report.  Present:  Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker. Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape. "As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that he must go by the Danube mouth, or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since by that way he come.  It was a dreary blank that was before us. Omme ignotum pro magnifico, and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night.  He was in sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set.  These not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the Times, and so we go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail, however so small.  There we find that only one Black Sea bound ship go out with the tide.  She is the Czarina Catherine, and she sail from Doolittle's Wharf for Varna, and thence to other ports and up the Danube.  'So!' said I, 'this is the ship whereon is the Count.'  So off we go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office.  From him we inquire of the goings of the Czarina Catherine.  He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same.  And when Quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us.  He come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot.  These be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty.  They say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean.  But nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know. "They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five o'clock comes a man so hurry.  A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning.  That he be all in black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time.  That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for where.  Some took him to the office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at
shore end of gangplank, and ask that the captain come to him.  The captain come, when told that he will be pay well, and though he swear much at the first he agree to term.  Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired.  He go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart on which a great box.  This he himself lift down, though it take several to put it on truck for the ship.  He give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place.  But the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be.  But he say 'no,' that he come not yet, for that he have much to do.  Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick, with blood, for that his ship will leave the place, of blood, before the turn of the tide, with blood.  Then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit, but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon.  The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues, tell him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen, with bloom upon them and also with blood, in his ship, with blood on her also.  And so, after asking where he might purchase ship forms, he departed. "No one knew where he went 'or bloomin' well cared' as they said, for they had something else to think of, well with blood again.  For it soon became apparent to all that the Czarina Catherine would not sail as was expected.  A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew, and grew.  Till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.  The captain swore polyglot, very polyglot, polyglot with bloom and blood, but he could do nothing.  The water rose and rose, and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether.  He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gangplank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed.  Then the captain replied that he wished that he and his box, old and with much bloom and blood, were in hell.  But the thin man did not be offend, and went down with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog.  He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.  Indeed they thought not of him, for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again.  My friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf.  However, the ship went out on the ebb tide, and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth.  She was then, when they told us, well out to sea. "And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the Danube mouth.  To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick.  And when we start to go on land more quick, and we meet him there.  Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset.  For then he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should.  There are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan.  We know all about where he go.  For we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be.  The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present his credentials.  And so our
merchant friend will have done his part.  When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, we say 'no,' for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs.  It must be done by us alone and in our own way." When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain that the Count had remained on board the ship.  He replied, "We have the best proof of that, your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this morning." I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the Count, for oh!  I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that he would surely go if the others went.  He answered in growing passion, at first quietly.  As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men. "Yes, it is necessary, necessary, necessary!  For your sake in the first, and then for the sake of humanity.  This monster has done much harm already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing.  All this have I told these others.  You, my dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or in that of your husband.  I have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren land, barren of peoples, and coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the work of centuries.  Were another of the Undead, like him, to try to do what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wonderous way.  The very place, where he have been alive, Undead for all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world.  There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.  There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify.  Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way, and in himself were from the first some great qualities.  In a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man.  In him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost.  And as his body keep strong and grow and thrive, so his brain grow too.  All this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him.  For it have to yield to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good.  And now this is what he is to us.  He have infect you, oh forgive me, my dear, that I must say such, but it is for good of you that I speak.  He infect you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have only to live, to live in your own old, sweet way, and so in time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanction, shall make you like to him.  This must not be!  We have sworn together that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God's own wish.  That the world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very existence would defame Him.  He have allowed us to redeem one soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more.  Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise.  And like them, if we fall, we fall in good cause."
He paused and I said, "But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from which he has been hunted?" "Aha!" he said, "your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall adopt him.  Your maneater, as they of India call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl unceasing till he get him.  This that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a maneater, and he never cease to prowl.  Nay, in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar.  In his life, his living life, he go over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground.  He be beaten back, but did he stay?  No!  He come again, and again, and again.  Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city.  What does he do?  He find out the place of all the world most of promise for him.  Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task.  He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers.  He study new tongues. He learn new social life, new environment of old ways, the politics, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was.  His glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire.  Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain.  For it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises.  He have done this alone, all alone!  From a ruin tomb in a forgotten land.  What more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him.  He that can smile at death, as we know him.  Who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples.  Oh!  If such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours.  But we are pledged to set the world free.  Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts all in secret.  For in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength.  It would be at once his sheath and his armor, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we love.  For the good of mankind, and for the honour and glory of God." After a general discussion it was determined that for tonight nothing be definitely settled.  That we should all sleep on the facts, and try to think out the proper conclusions.  Tomorrow, at breakfast, we are to meet again, and after making our conclusions known to one another, we shall decide on some definite cause of action . . . I feel a wonderful peace and rest tonight.  It is as if some haunting presence were removed from me.  Perhaps . . . My surmise was not finished, could not be, for I caught sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead, and I knew that I was still unclean.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 5 October.--We all arose early, and I think that sleep did much for each and all of us.  When we met at early breakfast there was more
general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience again. It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way, even by death, and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream.  It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was brought back to reality.  Even now, when I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realize that the cause of all our trouble is still existent.  Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells.  It is only now and again, when something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar.  We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action.  I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than reason.  We shall all have to speak frankly. And yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied.  I know that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be. But she will not, or cannot, give them utterance.  I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone.  I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work.  The Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called "the Vampire's baptism of blood." Well, there may be a poison that distills itself out of good things. In an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything!  One thing I know, that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is a terrible difficulty, an unknown danger, in the work before us.  The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech.  I dare not think further, for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!
Later.--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of things.  I could see that he had something on his mind, which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating about the bush a little, he said, "Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate.  Later, we may have to take the others into our confidence." Then he stopped, so I waited.  He went on, "Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing." A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing continued. "With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned before things go too far.  Our task is now in reality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance.  I can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face.  It is now but very, very slight.  But it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without prejudge.  Her teeth are sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard.  But these are not all, there is to her the silence now often, as so it was with Miss Lucy.  She did not speak, even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this.  If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have
hypnotize her first, and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?" I nodded acquiescence.  He went on, "Then, what we must do is to prevent this.  We must keep her ignorant of our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not.  This is a painful task!  Oh, so painful that it heartbreak me to think of it, but it must be.  When today we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by us." He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured.  I knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion.  For at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt.  I told him, and the effect was as I expected. It is now close to the time of our general gathering.  Van Helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it.  I really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.
Later.--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both Van Helsing and myself.  Mrs. Harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to embarrass us.  The Professor and I looked at each other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved.  For my own part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realized the danger herself, it was much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to confer alone again.  We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van Helsing roughly put the facts before us first, "The Czarina Catherine left the Thames yesterday morning.  It will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach Varna. But we can travel overland to the same place in three days.  Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to such weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear, and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us, then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. "Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest.  Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such preparations as may be necessary.  Of course we shall all go armed, armed against evil things, spiritual as well as physical." Here Quincey Morris added, "I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be that he shall get there before us.  I propose that we add Winchesters to our armament.  I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk?  What wouldn't we have given then for a repeater apiece!"
"Good!" said Van Helsing, "Winchesters it shall be.  Quincey's head is level at times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man.  In the meantime we can do nothing here.  And as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon?  It is as long to wait here as there.  Tonight and tomorrow we can get ready, and then if all be well, we four can set out on our journey." "We four?" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of us. "Of course!" answered the Professor quickly.  "You must remain to take care of your so sweet wife!" Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice, "Let us talk of that part of it in the morning.  I want to consult with Mina." I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not to disclose our plan to her, but he took no notice.  I looked at him significantly and coughed.  For answer he put his finger to his lips and turned away.
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 5 October, afternoon.--For some time after our meeting this morning I could not think.  The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought.  Mina's determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking.  And as I could not argue the matter with her, I could only guess.  I am as far as ever from a solution now.  The way the others received it, too puzzled me.  The last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us.  Mina is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child.  Her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness.  Thank God, there are such moments still for her.
Later.--How strange it all is.  I sat watching Mina's happy sleep, and I came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be.  As the evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly said, "Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A promise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to be broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears.  Quick, you must make it to me at once." "Mina," I said, "a promise like that, I cannot make at once.  I may have no right to make it." "But, dear one," she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes were like pole stars, "it is I who wish it.  And it is not for myself. You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right.  If he disagrees you
may do as you will.  Nay, more if you all agree, later you are absolved from the promise." "I promise!" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy. Though to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead. She said, "Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for the campaign against the Count.  Not by word, or inference, or implication, not at any time whilst this remains to me!"  And she solemnly pointed to the scar.  I saw that she was in earnest, and said solemnly, "I promise!" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had been shut between us.
Later, midnight.--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening. So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected somewhat with her gaiety.  As a result even I myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted.  We all retired early.  Mina is now sleeping like a little child.  It is wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble.  Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.  Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did tonight.  I shall try it.  Oh!  For a dreamless sleep. 6 October, morning.--Another surprise.  Mina woke me early, about the same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing.  I thought that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went for the Professor.  He had evidently expected some such call, for I found him dressed in his room.  His door was ajar, so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room.  He came at once. As he passed into the room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too. "No," she said quite simply, "it will not be necessary.  You can tell them just as well.  I must go with you on your journey." Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was.  After a moment's pause he asked, "But why?" "You must take me with you.  I am safer with you, and you shall be safer, too." "But why, dear Madam Mina?  You know that your safety is our solemnest duty.  We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than any of us from . . . from circumstances . . . things that have been."  He paused embarrassed. As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead.  "I know.  That is why I must go.  I can tell you now, whilst the sun is coming up.  I may not be able again.  I know that when the Count wills me I must go.  I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must by wile.  By any device to hoodwink, even Jonathan."  God saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel that look is noted to her ever-lasting honour.  I could only clasp her hand.  I could not speak.  My emotion was too great for even the relief of tears.
She went on.  "You men are brave and strong.  You are strong in your numbers, for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone.  Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotize me and so learn that which even I myself do not know." Dr. Van Helsing said gravely, "Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise.  You shall with us come.  And together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve." When he had spoken, Mina's long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen back on her pillow asleep.  She did not even wake when I had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room.  Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly.  We went to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also. He told them what Mina had said, and went on.  "In the morning we shall leave for Varna.  We have now to deal with a new factor, Madam Mina.  Oh, but her soul is true.  It is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done.  But it is most right, and we are warned in time.  There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives." "What shall we do exactly?" asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor paused before replying, "We shall at the first board that ship.  Then, when we have identified the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it.  This we shall fasten, for when it is there none can emerge, so that at least says the superstition.  And to superstition must we trust at the first.  It was man's faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still.  Then, when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we shall open the box, and . . . and all will be well." "I shall not wait for any opportunity," said Morris.  "When I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!"  I grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.  I think he understood my look.  I hope he did. "Good boy," said Dr. Van Helsing.  "Brave boy.  Quincey is all man. God bless him for it.  My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear.  I do but say what we may do . . . what we must do.  But, indeed, indeed we cannot say what we may do.  There are so many things which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say.  We shall all be armed, in all ways.  And when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack.  Now let us today put all our affairs in order.  Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete.  For none of us can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be.  As for me, my own affairs are regulate, and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make arrangements for the travel.  I shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey." There was nothing further to be said, and we parted.  I shall now settle up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come.
Later.--It is done.  My will is made, and all complete.  Mina if she survive is my sole heir.  If it should not be so, then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder. It is now drawing towards the sunset.  Mina's uneasiness calls my attention to it.  I am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal.  These occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all.  For each sunrise and sunset opens up some new danger, some new pain, which however, may in God's will be means to a good end.  I write all these things in the diary since my darling must not hear them now.  But if it may be that she can see them again, they shall be ready.  She is calling to me.
CHAPTER 25
DR SEWARD'S DIARY 11 October, Evening.--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept. I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset.  We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom.  When her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action.  This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon.  At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows.  When, however, the freedom ceases the change back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence. Tonight, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the signs of an internal struggle.  I put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself. Then, motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining, she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband's hand in hers, she began, "We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time!  I know that you will always be with me to the end."  This was to her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon her.  "In the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in store for any of us.  You are going to be so good to me to take me with you.  I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman, whose soul perhaps is lost, no, no, not yet, but is at any rate at stake, you will do.  But you must remember that I am not as you are.  There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me, which must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us.  Oh, my friends, you know
as well as I do, that my soul is at stake.  And though I know there is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!"  She looked appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband. "What is that way?" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice.  "What is that way, which we must not, may not, take?" "That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before the greater evil is entirely wrought.  I know, and you know, that were I once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you did my poor Lucy's.  Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here now, amidst the friends who love me.  But death is not all.  I cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done, is God's will.  Therefore, I on my part, give up here the certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!" We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude.  The faces of the others were set, and Harker's grew ashen grey.  Perhaps, he guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued, "This is what I can give into the hotch-pot."  I could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all seriousness.  "What will each of you give?  Your lives I know," she went on quickly, "that is easy for brave men.  Your lives are God's, and you can give them back to Him, but what will you give to me?"  She looked again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband's face.  Quincey seemed to understand, he nodded, and her face lit up.  "Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now.  You must promise me, one and all, even you, my beloved husband, that should the time come, you will kill me." "What is that time?"  The voice was Quincey's, but it was low and strained. "When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that I die that I may live.  When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head, or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!" Quincey was the first to rise after the pause.  He knelt down before her and taking her hand in his said solemnly, "I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps, lived as a man should to win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us.  And I promise you, too, that I shall make all certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come!" "My true friend!" was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as bending over, she kissed his hand. "I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!" said Van Helsing.  "And I!" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath.  I followed, myself.
Then her husband turned to her wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair, and asked, "And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?" "You too, my dearest," she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eyes.  "You must not shrink.  You are nearest and dearest and all the world to me.  Our souls are knit into one, for all life and all time.  Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy.  Their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored them to slay them.  It is men's duty towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial!  And oh, my dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at the hand of him that loves me best.  Dr. Van Helsing, I have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy's case to him who loved."  She stopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase, "to him who had best right to give her peace.  If that time shall come again, I look to you to make it a happy memory of my husband's life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me." "Again I swear!" came the Professor's resonant voice. Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and said, "And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget.  This time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity.  At such a time I myself might be . . . nay!  If the time ever come, shall be, leagued with your enemy against you. "One more request," she became very solemn as she said this, "it is not vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for me, if you will." We all acquiesced, but no one spoke.  There was no need to speak. "I want you to read the Burial Service."  She was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband.  Taking his hand in hers, she held it over her heart, and continued.  "You must read it over me some day. Whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us.  You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for then it will be in your voice in my memory forever, come what may!" "But oh, my dear one," he pleaded, "death is afar off from you." "Nay," she said, holding up a warning hand.  "I am deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!" "Oh, my wife, must I read it?" he said, before he began. "It would comfort me, my husband!" was all she said, and he began to read when she had got the book ready. How can I, how could anyone, tell of that strange scene, its solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror, and withal, its sweetness.  Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends
kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of her husband's voice, as in tones so broken and emotional that often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of the Dead.  I cannot go on . . . words . . . and v-voices . . . f-fail m-me! She was right in her instinct.  Strange as it was, bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it comforted us much.  And the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker's coming relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded.
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 15 October, Varna.--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th, got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the Orient Express.  We traveled night and day, arriving here at about five o'clock.  Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel, "the Odessus."  The journey may have had incidents.  I was, however, too eager to get on, to care for them.  Until the Czarina Catherine comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.  Thank God!  Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger.  Her colour is coming back.  She sleeps a great deal. Throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time.  Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very wakeful and alert.  And it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotize her at such times.  At first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes.  But now, she seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is needed.  He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him.  He always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first, "Nothing, all is dark." And to the second, "I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing by.  Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak.  The wind is high . . . I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam." It is evident that the Czarina Catherine is still at sea, hastening on her way to Varna.  Lord Godalming has just returned.  He had four telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect. That the Czarina Catherine had not been reported to Lloyd's from anywhere.  He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire. We had dinner and went to bed early.  Tomorrow we are to see the Vice Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives.  Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset.  The Count, even if he takes
the form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and so cannot leave the ship.  As he dare not change to man's form without suspicion, which he evidently wishes to avoid, he must remain in the box.  If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy, for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy, before he wakes.  What mercy he shall get from us all will not count for much.  We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen.  Thank God!  This is the country where bribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with money.  We have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned, and we shall be safe.  Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think!
16 October.--Mina's report still the same.  Lapping waves and rushing water, darkness and favouring winds.  We are evidently in good time, and when we hear of the Czarina Catherine we shall be ready.  As she must pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.
17 October.--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome the Count on his return from his tour.  Godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk.  The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a similar authorization to his agent at Varna.  We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming's kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open.  If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart.  Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready.  The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count's body, it will soon after fall into dust.  In such case there would be no evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused.  But even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope.  For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come.  We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent.  We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the Czarina Catherine is seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.
24 October.--A whole week of waiting.  Daily telegrams to Godalming, but only the same story.  "Not yet reported."  Mina's morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried.  Lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts.
TELEGRAM, OCTOBER 24TH RUFUS SMITH, LLOYD'S, LONDON, TO LORD GODALMING, CARE OF H. B. M. VICE CONSUL, VARNA
"Czarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles."
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 25 October.--How I miss my phonograph!  To write a diary with a pen is irksome to me!  But Van Helsing says I must.  We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd's.  I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs. Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After all, it is not strange that she did not, for we took special care not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence.  In old days she would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it.  But in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks.  The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied.  We talk of her often.  We have not, however, said a word to the others.  It would break poor Harker's heart, certainly his nerve, if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject.  Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her.  If this change should come, it would be necessary to take steps!  We both know what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other.  We should neither of us shrink from the task, awful though it be to contemplate.  "Euthanasia" is an excellent and a comforting word!  I am grateful to whoever invented it. It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the Czarina Catherine has come from London.  She should therefore arrive some time in the morning, but as she cannot possibly get in before noon, we are all about to retire early.  We shall get up at one o'clock, so as to be ready.
25 October, Noon.--No news yet of the ship's arrival.  Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment.  We men are all in a fever of excitement, except Harker, who is calm.  His hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him.  It will be a bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that "Kukri" ever touches his throat, driven by that stern, ice-cold hand! Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker today. About noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like. Although we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it.  She had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping.  When, however, her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves.  She was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else.  Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.
Later.--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days.  At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination.  To his doom, I trust!
26 October.--Another day and no tidings of the Czarina Catherine.  She ought to be here by now.  That she is still journeying somewhere is apparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same.  It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog.  Some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port.  We must continue our watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.
27 October, Noon.--Most strange.  No news yet of the ship we wait for. Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual.  "Lapping waves and rushing water," though she added that "the waves were very faint."  The telegrams from London have been the same, "no further report."  Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he fears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly, "I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina's. Souls and memories can do strange things during trance."  I was about to ask him more, but Harker just then came in, and he held up a warning hand.  We must try tonight at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.
28 October.--Telegram.  Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming, care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna "Czarina Catherine reported entering Galatz at one o'clock today."
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 28 October.--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected.  True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come.  But I think we all expected that something strange would happen.  The day of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected.  We only waited to learn where the change would occur.  None the less, however, it was a surprise.  I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know that they will be.  Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a will-o'-the-wisp to man.  Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty.  But he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily.  I was
myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well.  In our old wandering days it meant "action."  Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer.  Harker smiled, actually smiled, the dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope, but at the same time his action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there. "When does the next train start for Galatz?" said Van Helsing to us generally. "At 6:30 tomorrow morning!"  We all started, for the answer came from Mrs. Harker. "How on earth do you know?" said Art. "You forget, or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so does Dr. Van Helsing, that I am the train fiend.  At home in Exeter I always used to make up the time tables, so as to be helpful to my husband.  I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of the time tables now.  I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I learned the times very carefully.  Unhappily there are not many to learn, as the only train tomorrow leaves as I say." "Wonderful woman!" murmured the Professor. "Can't we get a special?" asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his head, "I fear not.  This land is very different from yours or mine.  Even if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train.  Moreover, we have something to prepare.  We must think.  Now let us organize.  You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning.  Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make a search of the ship just as it was here.  Quincey Morris, you see the Vice Consul, and get his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube.  John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult.  For so if time be long you may be delayed.  And it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make report." "And I," said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day, "shall try to be of use in all ways, and shall think and write for you as I used to do.  Something is shifting from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!" The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to realize the significance of her words.  But Van Helsing and I, turning to each other, met each a grave and troubled glance.  We said nothing at the time, however. When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.
Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of Harker's journal at the Castle.  She went away to get it. When the door was shut upon her he said to me, "We mean the same! Speak out!" "Here is some change.  It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may deceive us." "Quite so.  Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?" "No!" said I, "unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone." "You are in part right, friend John, but only in part.  I want to tell you something.  And oh, my friend, I am taking a great, a terrible, risk.  But I believe it is right.  In the moment when Madam Mina said those words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me.  In the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her mind.  Or more like he took her to see him in his earth box in the ship with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun.  He learn then that we are here, for she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see ears to hear than he, shut as he is, in his coffin box.  Now he make his most effort to escape us.  At present he want her not. "He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call.  But he cut her off, take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that so she come not to him.  Ah!  There I have hope that our man brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and therefore small.  Here comes Madam Mina.  Not a word to her of her trance!  She knows it not, and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope, all her courage, when most we want all her great brain which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away altogether, though he think not so.  Hush!  Let me speak, and you shall learn.  Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits.  I fear, as I never feared before.  We can only trust the good God.  Silence!  Here she comes!" I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright and happy looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly forgetful of her misery.  As she came in, she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing.  He looked over them gravely, his face brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said, "Friend John, to you with so much experience already, and you too, dear Madam Mina, that are young, here is a lesson.  Do not fear ever to think.  A half thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him loose his wings.  Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where that half thought come from and I find that he be no half thought at all.  That be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings.  Nay, like the 'Ugly Duck' of my
friend Hans Andersen, he be no duck thought at all, but a big swan thought that sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them.  See I read here what Jonathan have written. "That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land, who when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph. "What does this tell us?  Not much?  No!  The Count's child thought see nothing, therefore he speak so free.  Your man thought see nothing.  My man thought see nothing, till just now.  No!  But there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it mean, what it might mean.  Just as there are elements which rest, yet when in nature's course they move on their way and they touch, the pouf!  And there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some.  But that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues.  Is it not so?  Well, I shall explain.  To begin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime? 'Yes' and 'No.'  You, John, yes, for it is a study of insanity.  You, no, Madam Mina, for crime touch you not, not but once.  Still, your mind works true, and argues not a particulari ad universale.  There is this peculiarity in criminals.  It is so constant, in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that it is.  That is to be empiric.  The criminal always work at one crime, that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.  This criminal has not full man brain.  He is clever and cunning and resourceful, but he be not of man stature as to brain.  He be of child brain in much.  Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also.  He, too, have child brain, and it is of the child to do what he have done.  The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle, but empirically.  And when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground to start from to do more.  'Dos pou sto,' said Archimedes.  'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!'  To do once, is the fulcrum whereby child brain become man brain.  And until he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time, just as he have done before!  Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues," for Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on, "Now you shall speak.  Tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes."  He took her hand and held it whilst he spoke.  His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and unconsciously, as she spoke. "The Count is a criminal and of criminal type.  Nordau and Lombroso would so classify him, and qua criminal he is of an imperfectly formed mind.  Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit.  His past is a clue, and the one page of it that we know, and that from his own lips, tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a 'tight place,' he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself for a new effort.  He came again better equipped for his work, and won.  So he came to London to invade a new land.  He was beaten, and when all hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over the sea to his home.  Just as formerly he had fled back
over the Danube from Turkey Land." "Good, good!  Oh, you so clever lady!" said Van Helsing, enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand.  A moment later he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick room consultation, "Seventy-two only, and in all this excitement.  I have hope." Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation, "But go on.  Go on!  There is more to tell if you will.  Be not afraid.  John and I know.  I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.  Speak, without fear!" "I will try to.  But you will forgive me if I seem too egotistical." "Nay!  Fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think." "Then, as he is criminal he is selfish.  And as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one purpose.  That purpose is remorseless.  As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all.  So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night.  I felt it!  Oh, I felt it!  Thank God, for His great mercy!  My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour.  And all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends." The Professor stood up, "He has so used your mind, and by it he has left us here in Varna, whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.  But his child mind only saw so far.  And it may be that as ever is in God's Providence, the very thing that the evil doer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm.  The hunter is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says.  For now that he think he is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him, then his selfish child brain will whisper him to sleep.  He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him to you.  There is where he fail!  That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his.  And this power to good of you and others, you have won from your suffering at his hands. This is now all more precious that he know it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark hours.  We shall follow him, and we shall not flinch, even if we peril ourselves that we become like him.  Friend John, this has been a great hour, and it have done much to advance us on our way.  You must be scribe and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them, then they shall know as we do." And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker has written with the typewriter all since she brought the MS to us.
CHAPTER 26
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 29 October.--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz.  Last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset.  Each of us had done his work as well as he could, so far as thought, and endeavour, and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and for our work when we get to Galatz.  When the usual time came round Mrs. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort, and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually necessary, she sank into the trance.  Usually she speaks on a hint, but this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn anything.  At last her answer came. "I can see nothing.  We are still.  There are no waves lapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser.  I can hear men's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks.  A gun is fired somewhere, the echo of it seems far away.  There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged along.  What is this?  There is a gleam of light.  I can feel the air blowing upon me." Here she stopped.  She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a weight.  Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.  Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst Harker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri.  There was a long pause.  We all knew that the time when she could speak was passing, but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she sat up, and as she opened her eyes said sweetly, "Would none of you like a cup of tea?  You must all be so tired!" We could only make her happy, and so acqueisced.  She bustled off to get tea.  When she had gone Van Helsing said, "You see, my friends.  He is close to land.  He has left his earth chest.  But he has yet to get on shore.  In the night he may lie hidden somewhere, but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve the land.  In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form and jump or fly on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box contain.  Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore tonight, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.  We may then arrive in time.  For if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy.  For he dare not be his true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered." There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn, at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker. Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her response in her trance.  The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming
than before, and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair.  Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort.  At last, in obedience to his will she made reply. "All is dark.  I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as of wood on wood."  She paused, and the red sun shot up.  We must wait till tonight. And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of expectation.  We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning.  But already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot possibly get in till well after sunup.  Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker!  Either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening.
Later.--Sunset has come and gone.  Fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction.  For had it occurred whilst we were at a station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation. Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning.  I am in fear that her power of reading the Count's sensations may die away, just when we want it most.  It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work.  Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts.  If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us.  If I thought that the Count's power over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought.  But I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did speak, her words were enigmatical, "Something is going out.  I can feel it pass me like a cold wind.  I can hear, far off, confused sounds, as of men talking in strange tongues, fierce falling water, and the howling of wolves."  She stopped and a shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds, till at the end, she shook as though in a palsy.  She said no more, even in answer to the Professor's imperative questioning.  When she woke from the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid, but her mind was all alert.  She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said. When she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence.
30 October, 7 A.M.--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to write later.  Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all. Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance, Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual.  They produced no effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose.  The Professor lost no time in his questioning. Her answer came with equal quickness, "All is dark.  I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off.  There is another sound, a queer one like . . ." She stopped and grew white, and whiter still. "Go on, go on!  Speak, I command you!" said Van Helsing in an agonized voice.  At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen
sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker's pale face.  She opened her eyes, and we all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern. "Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can't?  I don't remember anything."  Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look, "What have I said?  What have I done?  I know nothing, only that I was lying here, half asleep, and heard you say 'go on! speak, I command you!'  It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad child!" "Oh, Madam Mina," he said, sadly, "it is proof, if proof be needed, of how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I am proud to obey!" The whistles are sounding.  We are nearing Galatz.  We are on fire with anxiety and eagerness.
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 30 October.--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since he does not speak any foreign language.  The forces were distributed much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the Vice Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry.  Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the Czarina Catherine.
Later.--Lord Godalming has returned.  The Consul is away, and the Vice Consul sick.  So the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.  He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 30 October.--At nine o'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of Hapgood.  They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord Godalming's telegraphed request, asking them to show us any civility in their power.  They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once on board the Czarina Catherine, which lay at anchor out in the river harbor.  There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage.  He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run. "Man!" he said, "but it made us afeard, for we expect it that we should have to pay for it wi' some rare piece o' ill luck, so as to keep up the average.  It's no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi' a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin' on yer sail for his ain purpose.  An' a' the time we could no speer a thing.  Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi' us, till when after it had lifted and we
looked out, the deil a thing could we see.  We ran by Gibraltar wi' oot bein' able to signal.  An' til we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o' aught.  At first I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted.  But whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no.  If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic, an' the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin' him." This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said, "Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some, and he know when he meet his match!" The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on, "When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble.  Some o' them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin' old man just before we had started frae London.  I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa fingers when they saw him, to guard them against the evil eye.  Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous!  I sent them aboot their business pretty quick, but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn't say it was again the big box.  Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up for five days I joost let the wind carry us, for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres, well, he would fetch it up a'reet.  An' if he didn't, well, we'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow.  Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the time.  And two days ago, when the mornin' sun came through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.  The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river.  I had to argy wi' them aboot it wi' a handspike.  An' when the last o' them rose off the deck wi' his head in his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as it was marked Galatz via Varna, I thocht I'd let it lie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither.  We didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor.  But in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sunup, a man came aboard wi' an order, written to him from England, to receive a box marked for one Count Dracula.  Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand.  He had his papers a' reet, an' glad I was to be rid o' the dam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy at it.  If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm thinkin' it was nane ither than that same!" "What was the name of the man who took it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing with restrained eagerness. "I'll be tellin' ye quick!" he answered, and stepping down to his cabin, produced a receipt signed "Immanuel Hildesheim."  Burgen-strasse 16 was the address.  We found out that this was all the Captain knew, so with thanks we came away. We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi
Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez.  His arguments were pointed with specie, we doing the punctuation, and with a little bargaining he told us what he knew.  This turned out to be simple but important.  He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the Czarina Catherine. This he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port.  He had been paid for his work by an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube International Bank.  When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage.  That was all he knew. We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him.  One of his neighbors, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither.  This was corroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due, in English money.  This had been between ten and eleven o'clock last night.  We were at a standstill again. Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal.  Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women crying out.  "This is the work of a Slovak!"  We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained. As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion.  We were all convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere, but where that might be we would have to discover.  With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to Mina. When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina again into our confidence.  Things are getting desperate, and it is at least a chance, though a hazardous one.  As a preliminary step, I was released from my promise to her.
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 30 October, evening.--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest, so I asked them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything up to the moment.  I feel so grateful to the man who invented the "Traveller's" typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for me.  I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write with a pen . . . It is all done.  Poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered, what he must be suffering now.  He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse.  His brows are knit. His face is drawn with pain.  Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his
thoughts.  Oh! if I could only help at all.  I shall do what I can. I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I have not yet seen.  Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion.  I shall try to follow the Professor's example, and think without prejudice on the facts before me . . . I do believe that under God's providence I have made a discovery.  I shall get the maps and look over them. I am more than ever sure that I am right.  My new conclusion is ready, so I shall get our party together and read it.  They can judge it.  It is well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.
MINA HARKER'S MEMORANDUM (ENTERED IN HER JOURNAL)
Ground of inquiry.--Count Dracula's problem is to get back to his own place. (a) He must be brought back by some one.  This is evident; for had he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf, or bat, or in some other way.  He evidently fears discovery or interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be, confined as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box. (b) How is he to be taken?--Here a process of exclusions may help us.  By road, by rail, by water? 1.  By Road.--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the city. (x) There are people.  And people are curious, and investigate.  A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him. (y) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass. (z) His pursuers might follow.  This is his highest fear. And in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even his victim, me! 2.  By Rail.--There is no one in charge of the box.  It would have to take its chance of being delayed, and delay would be fatal, with enemies on the track.  True, he might escape at night.  But what would he be, if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to?  This is not what he intends, and he does not mean to risk it. 3.  By Water.--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most danger in another.  On the water he is powerless
except at night.  Even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves.  But were he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless, and he would indeed be lost.  He could have the vessel drive to land, but if it were unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would still be desperate. We know from the record that he was on the water, so what we have to do is to ascertain what water. The first thing is to realize exactly what he has done as yet.  We may, then, get a light on what his task is to be. Firstly.--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could. Secondly.--We must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of, what he has done here. As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from England.  His immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.  The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise.  There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky.  These we must only guess at, but there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim. That, so far, his plans were successful we know.  The Czarina Catherine made a phenomenally quick journey.  So much so that Captain Donelson's suspicions were aroused.  But his superstition united with his canniness played the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz.  That the Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved.  Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky.  Skinsky took it, and here we lose the trail.  We only know that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along.  The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided. Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival, on land, at Galatz. The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise.  At sunrise the Count could appear in his own form.  Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work?  In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port.  And the man's remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general feeling against his class.  The Count wanted isolation. My surmise is this, that in London the Count decided to get back to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret way.  He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped to London.  Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service.  When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his
box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river.  When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent. I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth.  I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood.  The Count in his box, then, was on a river in an open boat, propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream.  There would be no such if floating down stream. Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may possibly investigate further.  Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass.  The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Dracula's castle as can be got by water.
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL--CONTINUED When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said, "Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher.  Her eyes have been where we were blinded.  Now we are on the track once again, and this time we may succeed.  Our enemy is at his most helpless.  And if we can come on him by day, on the water, our task will be over.  He has a start, but he is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave this box lest those who carry him may suspect.  For them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish.  This he knows, and will not.  Now men, to our Council of War, for here and now, we must plan what each and all shall do." "I shall get a steam launch and follow him," said Lord Godalming. "And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land," said Mr. Morris. "Good!" said the Professor, "both good.  But neither must go alone. There must be force to overcome force if need be.  The Slovak is strong and rough, and he carries rude arms."  All the men smiled, for amongst them they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris, "I have brought some Winchesters.  They are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may be wolves.  The Count, if you remember, took some other precautions.  He made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could not quite hear or understand.  We must be ready at all points." Dr. Seward said, "I think I had better go with Quincey.  We have been accustomed to hunt together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come along.  You must not be alone, Art.  It may be necessary to fight the Slovaks, and a chance thrust, for I don't
suppose these fellows carry guns, would undo all our plans.  There must be no chances, this time.  We shall not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, and we are sure that he cannot reincarnate." He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me.  I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind.  Of course he wanted to be with me.  But then the boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the . . . the . . . Vampire.  (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke, "Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons.  First, because you are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the last.  And again that it is your right to destroy him.  That, which has wrought such woe to you and yours.  Be not afraid for Madam Mina.  She will be my care, if I may.  I am old.  My legs are not so quick to run as once.  And I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to fight with lethal weapons.  But I can be of other service.  I can fight in other way.  And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men.  Now let me say that what I would is this.  While you, my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy's country.  Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to land, where he dares not raise the lid of his coffin box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perish, we shall go in the track where Jonathan went, from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula.  Here, Madam Mina's hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way, all dark and unknown otherwise, after the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place.  There is much to be done, and other places to be made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated." Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly, "Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina, in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness, right into the jaws of his deathtrap?  Not for the world!  Not for Heaven or Hell!" He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on, "Do you know what the place is?  Have you seen that awful den of hellish infamy, with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo? Have you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat?" Here he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry, "Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us?" and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor's voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us all. "Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful place that I would go.  God forbid that I should take her into that place.  There is work, wild work, to be done before that place can be purify.  Remember that we are in terrible straits.  If the Count escape us this time, and he is strong and subtle and cunning, he may
choose to sleep him for a century, and then in time our dear one," he took my hand, "would come to him to keep him company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw.  You have told us of their gloating lips.  You heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them.  You shudder, and well may it be.  Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is necessary.  My friend, is it not a dire need for that which I am giving, possibly my life?  If it were that any one went into that place to stay, it is I who would have to go to keep them company." "Do as you will," said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, "we are in the hands of God!"
Later.--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked. How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and so brave!  And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!  What can it not do when basely used.  I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely.  For if they did not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour.  It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do.  And now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's notice.  Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed.  We have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had.  Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train tonight for Veresti, where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass.  We are bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and horses.  We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust in the matter.  The Professor knows something of a great many languages, so we shall get on all right.  We have all got arms, even for me a large bore revolver.  Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like the rest.  Alas!  I cannot carry one arm that the rest do, the scar on my forehead forbids that.  Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves.  The weather is getting colder every hour, and there are snow flurries which come and go as warnings.
Later.--It took all my courage to say goodbye to my darling.  We may never meet again.  Courage, Mina!  The Professor is looking at you keenly.  His look is a warning.  There must be no tears now, unless it may be that God will let them fall in gladness.
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 30 October, night.--I am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch.  Lord Godalming is firing up.  He is an experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads.  Regarding our plans, we finally decided that Mina's guess was correct, and that if any waterway was chosen for the Count's escape back to his Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one.  We took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would
be the place chosen for crossing the country between the river and the Carpathians.  We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night.  There is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough.  Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch.  But I cannot sleep, how can I with the terrible danger hanging over my darling, and her going out into that awful place . . . My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God.  Only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble.  Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started.  They are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves.  They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead their spare horses, four in all, so as not to excite curiosity.  When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look after the horses.  It may be necessary for us to join forces.  If so they can mount our whole party.  One of the saddles has a moveable horn, and can be easily adapted for Mina, if required. It is a wild adventure we are on.  Here, as we are rushing along through the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us, with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes home.  We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways.  Into a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the furnace door . . .
31 October.--Still hurrying along.  The day has come, and Godalming is sleeping.  I am on watch.  The morning is bitterly cold, the furnace heat is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats.  As yet we have passed only a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek.  The men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and prayed.
1 November, evening.--No news all day.  We have found nothing of the kind we seek.  We have now passed into the Bistritza, and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone.  We have overhauled every boat, big and little.  Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated us accordingly.  We saw in this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously.  With every boat which we have overhauled since then this trick has succeeded.  We have had every deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do.  Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board.  This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth.  At Fundu we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the night.  I am feeling very sleepy.  The cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me, and nature must have rest some time.  Godalming insists that he shall keep the first watch.  God bless him for all his goodness to poor dear Mina and me.
2 November, morning.--It is broad daylight.  That good fellow would not wake me.  He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble.  It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long, and let him watch all night, but he was quite right.  I am a new man this morning.  And, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and keeping watch.  I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me.  I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing.  They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday.  It would take them some time to get the carriage and horses.  So if they had started and travelled hard, they would be about now at the Borgo Pass.  God guide and help them!  I am afraid to think what may happen.  If we could only go faster.  But we cannot.  The engines are throbbing and doing their utmost.  I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on.  There seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them are very large, at present, at all events, though they are doubtless terrible in winter and when the snow melts, the horsemen may not have met much obstruction.  I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them. For if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 2 November.--Three days on the road.  No news, and no time to write it if there had been, for every moment is precious.  We have had only the rest needful for the horses.  But we are both bearing it wonderfully. Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful.  We must push on.  We shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.
3 November.--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the Bistritza.  I wish it wasn't so cold.  There are signs of snow coming. And if it falls heavy it will stop us.  In such case we must get a sledge and go on, Russian fashion. 4 November.--Today we heard of the launch having been detained by an accident when trying to force a way up the rapids.  The Slovak boats get up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge.  Some went up only a few hours before.  Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase afresh.  I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident, the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight.  We must push on harder than ever.  Our help may be wanted soon.
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 31 October.--Arrived at Veresti at noon.  The Professor tells me that this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotize me at all, and that all I could say was, "dark and quiet."  He is off now buying a carriage and horses.  He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so that we may be able to change them on the way.  We have something more than 70 miles before us.  The country is lovely, and most interesting.  If only we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to see it all.  If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a pleasure it would be.  To stop and see people, and learn something of their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint people!  But, alas!
Later.--Dr. Van Helsing has returned.  He has got the carriage and horses.  We are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour.  The landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions.  It seems enough for a company of soldiers.  The Professor encourages her, and whispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any food again. He has been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats and wraps, and all sorts of warm things.  There will not be any chance of our being cold. We shall soon be off.  I am afraid to think what may happen to us.  We are truly in the hands of God.  He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him, with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over my beloved husband.  That whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and truest thought will be always for him.
CHAPTER 27
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 1 November.--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed.  The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best speed.  We have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one.  Dr. Van Helsing is laconic, he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses.  We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea, and off we go.  It is a lovely country.  Full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities.  They are very, very superstitious.  In the first house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye.  I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food, and I can't abide garlic.  Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their suspicions.  We are travelling fast, and as we have no driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal.  But I daresay that fear of
the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way.  The Professor seems tireless.  All day he would not take any rest, though he made me sleep for a long spell.  At sunset time he hypnotized me, and he says I answered as usual, "darkness, lapping water and creaking wood."  So our enemy is still on the river.  I am afraid to think of Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself.  I write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be ready.  Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping.  Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's.  Even in his sleep he is intense with resolution.  When we have well started I must make him rest whilst I drive.  I shall tell him that we have days before us, and he must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed . . . All is ready.  We are off shortly.
2 November, morning.--I was successful, and we took turns driving all night.  Now the day is on us, bright though cold.  There is a strange heaviness in the air.  I say heaviness for want of a better word.  I mean that it oppresses us both.  It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep us comfortable.  At dawn Van Helsing hypnotized me.  He says I answered "darkness, creaking wood and roaring water," so the river is changing as they ascend.  I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of danger, more than need be, but we are in God's hands.
2 November, night.--All day long driving.  The country gets wilder as we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us and tower in front.  We both seem in good spirits.  I think we make an effort each to cheer the other, in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr. Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change.  He got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude four-in-hand.  The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no trouble.  We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can drive.  We shall get to the Pass in daylight.  We do not want to arrive before.  So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn.  Oh, what will tomorrow bring to us?  We go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much.  God grant that we may be guided aright, and that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both, and who are in such deadly peril.  As for me, I am not worthy in His sight.  Alas!  I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred His wrath.
MEMORANDUM BY ABRAHAM VAN HELSING 4 November.--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him.  It may explain.  It is morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept alive, Madam Mina aiding me.  It is cold, cold.  So cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all winter as the
ground is hardening to receive it.  It seems to have affected Madam Mina.  She has been so heavy of head all day that she was not like herself.  She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps!  She who is usual so alert, have done literally nothing all the day.  She even have lost her appetite.  She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so faithful at every pause.  Something whisper to me that all is not well.  However, tonight she is more /vif/.  Her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever.  At sunset I try to hypnotize her, but alas! with no effect.  The power has grown less and less with each day, and tonight it fail me altogether. Well, God's will be done, whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead! Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go unrecorded. We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning.  When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism.  We stopped our carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance.  I made a couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep.  As before, came the answer, "darkness and the swirling of water."  Then she woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.  At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal.  Some new guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say, "This is the way." "How know you it?" I ask. "Of course I know it," she answer, and with a pause, add, "Have not my Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?" At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one such byroad.  It is used but little, and very different from the coach road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and more of use. So we came down this road.  When we meet other ways, not always were we sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow have fallen, the horses know and they only.  I give rein to them, and they go on so patient.  By and by we find all the things which Jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him.  Then we go on for long, long hours and hours.  At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep.  She try, and she succeed.  She sleep all the time, till at the last, I feel myself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her.  But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try.  I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm her.  For I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her.  I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel guilt, as though I have done something.  I find myself bolt up, with the reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever.  I look down and find Madam Mina still asleep.  It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so
steep.  For we are going up, and up, and all is oh so wild and rocky, as though it were the end of the world. Then I arouse Madam Mina.  This time she wake with not much trouble, and then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep.  But she sleep not, being as though I were not.  Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and myself in dark, so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.  Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her.  She is now quite awake, and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we first enter the Count's house.  I am amaze, and not at ease then.  But she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear.  I light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter, to feed.  Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready.  I go to help her, but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already.  That she was so hungry that she would not wait.  I like it not, and I have grave doubts.  But I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it.  She help me and I eat alone, and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch.  But presently I forget all of watching.  And when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes.  Once, twice more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning.  When I wake I try to hypnotize her, but alas! though she shut her eyes obedient, she may not sleep.  The sun rise up, and up, and up, and then sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake.  I have to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready.  Madam still sleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before.  And I like it not.  And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!  I am afraid of all things, even to think but I must go on my way.  The stake we play for is life and death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.
5 November, morning.--Let me be accurate in everything, for though you and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think that I, Van Helsing, am mad. That the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain. All yesterday we travel, always getting closer to the mountains, and moving into a more and more wild and desert land.  There are great, frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival.  Madam Mina still sleep and sleep.  And though I did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her, even for food.  I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism.  "Well," said I to myself, "if it be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at night."  As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down.  But
all was indeed changed.  The frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a steep rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary.  At once I exulted and feared.  For now, for good or ill, the end was near. I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotize her, but alas!  unavailing till too late.  Then, ere the great dark came upon us, for even after down sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight.  I took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I could.  Then I make a fire, and near it I make Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid her rugs. I got ready food, but she would not eat, simply saying that she had not hunger.  I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all.  Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round where Madam Mina sat.  And over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was well guarded.  She sat still all the time, so still as one dead. And she grew whiter and even whiter till the snow was not more pale, and no word she said.  But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet, "Will you not come over to the fire?" for I wished to make a test of what she could.  She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she stopped, and stood as one stricken. "Why not go on?" I asked.  She shook her head, and coming back, sat down in her place.  Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, she said simply, "I cannot!" and remained silent.  I rejoiced, for I knew that what she could not, none of those that we dreaded could.  Though there might be danger to her body, yet her soul was safe! Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them.  When they did feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time.  Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest, and every time my coming was with quiet of them.  In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist.  Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow, and it seemed as though the snow flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments.  All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst.  I began to fear, horrible fears.  But then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood.  I began too, to think that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety.  It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's horrid experience were befooling me.  For the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a
shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him.  And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain.  Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away.  I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round.  I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me.  When I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was. "No!  No!  Do not go without.  Here you are safe!" I turned to her, and looking in her eyes said, "But you? It is for you that I fear!" Whereat she laughed, a laugh low and unreal, and said, "Fear for me!  Why fear for me?  None safer in all the world from them than I am," and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.  Then, alas!  I knew.  Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy circle.  Then they began to materialize till, if God have not taken away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes. There were before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissed his throat.  I knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips.  They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina.  And as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water glasses, "Come, sister.  Come to us. Come!" In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame.  For oh! the terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was all of hope.  God be thanked she was not, yet, of them.  I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire.  They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh.  I fed the fire, and feared them not.  For I knew that we were safe within the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter.  The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground.  The snow fell on them softly, and they grew whiter.  I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror. And so we remained till the red of the dawn began to fall through the snow gloom.  I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror.  But when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.  At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow.  The wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle, and were lost. Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending to hypnotize her.  But she lay in a deep and sudden
sleep, from which I could not wake her.  I tried to hypnotize through her sleep, but she made no response, none at all, and the day broke.  I fear yet to stir.  I have made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead.  Today I have much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high.  For there may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist obscure it, will be to me a safety. I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will do my terrible work.  Madam Mina still sleeps, and God be thanked!  She is calm in her sleep . . .
JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL 4 November, evening.--The accident to the launch has been a terrible thing for us.  Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago, and by now my dear Mina would have been free.  I fear to think of her, off on the wolds near that horrid place.  We have got horses, and we follow on the track.  I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We have our arms.  The Szgany must look out if they mean to fight.  Oh, if only Morris and Seward were with us.  We must only hope!  If I write no more Goodby Mina!  God bless and keep you.
DR. SEWARD'S DIARY 5 November.--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing away from the river with their leiter wagon.  They surrounded it in a cluster, and hurried along as though beset.  The snow is falling lightly and there is a strange excitement in the air.  It may be our own feelings, but the depression is strange.  Far off I hear the howling of wolves.  The snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are dangers to all of us, and from all sides.  The horses are nearly ready, and we are soon off.  We ride to death of some one.  God alone knows who, or where, or what, or when, or how it may be . . .
DR. VAN HELSING'S MEMORANDUM 5 November, afternoon.--I am at least sane.  Thank God for that mercy at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful.  When I left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.  The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful, though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges, lest some ill intent or ill chance should close them, so that being entered I might not get out.  Jonathan's bitter experience served me here.  By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I knew that here my work lay.  The air was oppressive.  It seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy.  Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.  Then I bethought me of my dear Madam
Mina, and I was in terrible plight.  The dilemma had me between his horns. Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the Vampire in that Holy circle.  And yet even there would be the wolf!  I resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must submit, if it were God's will.  At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond.  So did I choose for her.  Had it but been for myself the choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the Vampire!  So I make my choice to go on with my work. I knew that there were at least three graves to find, graves that are inhabit.  So I search, and search, and I find one of them.  She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I have come to do murder.  Ah, I doubt not that in the old time, when such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve.  So he delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton Undead have hypnotize him.  And he remain on and on, till sunset come, and the Vampire sleep be over.  Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a kiss, and the man is weak.  And there remain one more victim in the Vampire fold.  One more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Undead! . . . There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the Count have had.  Yes, I was moved.  I, Van Helsing, with all my purpose and with my motive for hate.  I was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyze my faculties and to clog my very soul.  It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me.  Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion.  For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard. Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching away tomb tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one.  I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should begin to be enthrall.  But I go on searching until, presently, I find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist.  She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion.  But God be thanked, that soul wail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears. And, before the spell could be wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work.  By this time I had searched all
the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell.  And as there had been only three of these Undead phantoms around us in the night, I took it that there were no more of active Undead existent.  There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest.  Huge it was, and nobly proportioned.  On it was but one word.
            DRACULA
This then was the Undead home of the King Vampire, to whom so many more were due.  Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.  Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful work, I laid in Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished him from it, Undead, for ever. Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it.  Had it been but one, it had been easy, comparative.  But three!  To begin twice more after I had been through a deed of horror. For it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years.  Who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives . . . Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work.  Had I not been nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on.  I tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand.  Had I not seen the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came, as realization that the soul had been won, I could not have gone further with my butchery.  I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home, the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam.  I should have fled in terror and left my work undone.  But it is over!  And the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading.  For, friend John, hardly had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and crumble into its native dust, as though the death that should have come centuries ago had at last assert himself and say at once and loud, "I am here!" Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can the Count enter there Undead. When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her sleep and, seeing me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much. "Come!" she said, "come away from this awful place!  Let us go to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards us." She was looking thin and pale and weak.  But her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour.  I was glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that
ruddy vampire sleep. And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet our friends, and him, whom Madam Mina tell me that she know are coming to meet us.
MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL 6 November.--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming.  We did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us.  We dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow.  We had to take some of our provisions too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and so far as we could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of habitation.  When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest.  Then we looked back and saw where the clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky.  For we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far below it.  We saw it in all its grandeur, perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side.  There was something wild and uncanny about the place.  We could hear the distant howling of wolves.  They were far off, but the sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was full of terror.  I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less exposed in case of attack.  The rough roadway still led downwards.  We could trace it through the drifted snow. In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined him.  He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders.  He took me by the hand and drew me in. "See!" he said, "here you will be in shelter.  And if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one." He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and forced them upon me.  But I could not eat, to even try to do so was repulsive to me, and much as I would have liked to please him, I could not bring myself to the attempt.  He looked very sad, but did not reproach me.  Taking his field glasses from the case, he stood on the top of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out, "Look!  Madam Mina, look!  Look!" I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock.  He handed me his glasses and pointed.  The snow was now falling more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and I could see a long way round.  From the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance.  And far off, beyond the
white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way.  Straight in front of us and not far off, in fact so near that I wondered we had not noticed before, came a group of mounted men hurrying along.  In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the snow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind. On the cart was a great square chest.  My heart leaped as I saw it, for I felt that the end was coming.  The evening was now drawing close, and well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude pursuit.  In fear I turned to the Professor.  To my consternation, however, he was not there.  An instant later, I saw him below me.  Round the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again saying, "At least you shall be safe here from him!"  He took the glasses from me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.  "See," he said, "they come quickly.  They are flogging the horses, and galloping as hard as they can." He paused and went on in a hollow voice, "They are racing for the sunset.  We may be too late.  God's will be done!"  Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted out.  It soon passed, however, and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry, "Look!  Look!  Look!  See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south.  It must be Quincey and John.  Take the glass.  Look before the snow blots it all out!"  I took it and looked.  The two men might be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris.  I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.  At the same time I knew that Jonathan was not far off.  Looking around I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at breakneck speed.  One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took, of course, to be Lord Godalming.  They too, were pursuing the party with the cart.  When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter. "They are all converging," he said.  "When the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides."  I got out my revolver ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.  It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us, and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops.  Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers. The wolves were gathering for their prey. Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited.  The wind came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies.  At times we could not see an arm's length before us.  But at others, as the hollow sounding wind swept by us, it seemed
to clear the air space around us so that we could see afar off.  We had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be.  And we knew that before long the sun would set.  It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us.  The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north.  It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for with only occasional bursts, the snow fell.  We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers.  Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realize, or at least to care, that they were pursued.  They seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops. Closer and closer they drew.  The Professor and I crouched down behind our rock, and held our weapons ready.  I could see that he was determined that they should not pass.  One and all were quite unaware of our presence. All at once two voices shouted out to "Halt!"  One was my Jonathan's, raised in a high key of passion.  The other Mr. Morris' strong resolute tone of quiet command.  The gypsies may not have known the language, but there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken.  Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the other.  The leader of the gypsies, a splendid looking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed.  They lashed the horses which sprang forward.  But the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.  Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up.  The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant. The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in front, and pointed first to the sun, now close down on the hill tops, and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand. For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart.  I should have felt terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardor of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them.  I felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something.  Seeing the quick movement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command.  His men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order. In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart.  It was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set.  Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them.  Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention.  Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his
purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him.  Instinctively they cowered aside and let him pass.  In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground.  In the meantime, Mr. Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany.  All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had, with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him.  He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I thought that he too had come through in safety.  But as he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurting through his fingers.  He did not delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his bowie.  Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield.  The nails drew with a screeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back. By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made no further resistance.  The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell upon the snow.  I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him.  He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew so well. As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph. But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.  I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat.  Whilst at the same moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart. It was like a miracle, but before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight. I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested there. The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun. The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as if for their lives.  Those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiter wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them.  The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone. Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his hand pressed to his side.  The blood still gushed through his fingers.  I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the two doctors.  Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man
laid back his head on his shoulder.  With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said, "I am only too happy to have been of service!  Oh, God!" he cried suddenly, struggling to a sitting posture and pointing to me. "It was worth for this to die!  Look!  Look!" The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light.  With one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest "Amen" broke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man spoke, "Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain!  See!  The snow is not more stainless than her forehead!  The curse has passed away!" And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a gallant gentleman.
NOTE
Seven years ago we all went through the flames.  And the happiness of some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy's birthday is the same day as that on which Quincey Morris died.  His mother holds, I know, the secret belief that some of our brave friend's spirit has passed into him.  His bundle of names links all our little band of men together.  But we call him Quincey. In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and terrible memories.  It was almost impossible to believe that the things which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths.  Every trace of all that had been was blotted out.  The castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation. When we got home we were talking of the old time, which we could all look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily married.  I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since our return so long ago.  We were struck with the fact, that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one authentic document.  Nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later notebooks of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing's memorandum.  We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story.  Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with our boy on his knee. "We want no proofs.  We ask none to believe us!  This boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is.  Already he knows her sweetness and loving care.  Later on he will understand how some men so loved her, that they did dare much for her sake."

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page) We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+ We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002 If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

A. M. Turing (1950) Computing Machinery and Intelligence. Mind 49: 433-460.   
COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE  
By A. M. Turing 
1. The Imitation Game 
I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the terms "machine" and "think." The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous, If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words. 
The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the 'imitation game." It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart front the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either "X is A and Y is B" or "X is B and Y is A." The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus: 
C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair? 
Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the game to try and cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be: 
"My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long." 
In order that tones of voice may not help the interrogator the answers should be written, or better still, typewritten. The ideal arrangement is to have a teleprinter communicating between the two rooms. Alternatively the question and answers can be repeated by an intermediary. The object of the game for the third player (B) is to help the interrogator. The best strategy for her is probably to give truthful answers. She can add such things as "I am the woman, don't listen to him!" to her answers, but it will avail nothing as the man can make similar remarks.  
We now ask the question, "What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, "Can machines think?"  
2. Critique of the New Problem 
As well as asking, "What is the answer to this new form of the question," one may ask, "Is this new question a worthy one to investigate?" This latter question we investigate without further ado, thereby cutting short an infinite regress. 
The new problem has the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between the physical and the intellectual capacities of a man. No engineer or chemist claims to be able to produce a material which is indistinguishable from the human skin. It is possible that at some time this might be done, but even supposing this invention available we should feel there was little point in trying to make a "thinking machine" more human by dressing it up in such artificial flesh. The form in which we have set the problem reflects this fact in the condition which prevents the interrogator from seeing or touching the other competitors, or hearing -their voices. Some other advantages of the proposed criterion may be shown up by specimen questions and answers. Thus: 
Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. 
A : Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry. 
Q: Add 34957 to 70764. 
A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621. 
Q: Do you play chess? 
A: Yes. 
Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play?  
A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate. 
The question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing almost any one of the fields of human endeavour that we wish to include. We do not wish to penalise the machine for its inability to shine in beauty competitions, nor to penalise a man for losing in a race against an aeroplane. The conditions of our game make these disabilities irrelevant. The "witnesses" can brag, if they consider it advisable, as much as they please about their charms, strength or heroism, but the interrogator cannot demand practical demonstrations. 
The game may perhaps be criticised on the ground that the odds are weighted too heavily against the machine. If the man were to try and pretend to be the machine he would clearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away at once by slowness and inaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does? This objection is 
a very strong one, but at least we can say that if, nevertheless, a machine can be constructed to play the imitation game satisfactorily, we need not be troubled by this objection. 
It might be urged that when playing the "imitation game" the best strategy for the machine may possibly be something other than imitation of the behaviour of a man. This may be, but I think it is unlikely that there is any great effect of this kind. In any case there is no intention to investigate here the theory of the game, and it will be assumed that the best strategy is to try to provide answers that would naturally be given by a man. 
3. The Machines Concerned in the Game 
The question which we put in 1 will not be quite definite until we have specified what we mean by the word "machine." It is natural that we should wish to permit every kind of engineering technique to be used in our machines. We also wish to allow the possibility than an engineer or team of engineers may construct a machine which works, but whose manner of operation cannot be satisfactorily described by its constructors because they have applied a method which is largely experimental. Finally, we wish to exclude from the machines men born in the usual manner. It is difficult to frame the definitions so as to satisfy these three conditions. One might for instance insist that the team of engineers should be all of one sex, but this would not really be satisfactory, for it is probably possible to rear a complete individual from a single cell of the skin (say) of a man. To do so would be a feat of biological technique deserving of the very highest praise, but we would not be inclined to regard it as a case of "constructing a thinking machine." This prompts us to abandon the requirement that every kind of technique should be permitted. We are the more ready to do so in view of the fact that the present interest in "thinking machines" has been aroused by a particular kind of machine, usually called an "electronic computer" or "digital computer." Following this suggestion we only permit digital computers to take part in our game. 
This restriction appears at first sight to be a very drastic one. I shall attempt to show that it is not so in reality. To do this necessitates a short account of the nature and properties of these computers. 
It may also be said that this identification of machines with digital computers, like our criterion for "thinking," will only be unsatisfactory if (contrary to my belief), it turns out that digital computers are unable to give a good showing in the game. 
There are already a number of digital computers in working order, and it may be asked, "Why not try the experiment straight away? It would be easy to satisfy the conditions of the game. A number of interrogators could be used, and statistics compiled to show how often the right identification was given." The short answer is that we are not asking whether all digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers at present available would do well, but whether there are imaginable computers which would do well. But this is only the short answer. We shall see this question in a different light later. 
4. Digital Computers 
The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer. The human computer is supposed to be following fixed rules; he has no authority to deviate from them in any detail. We may suppose that these rules are supplied in a book, which is altered whenever he is put on to a new job. He has also an unlimited supply of paper on which he does his calculations. He may also do his multiplications and additions on a "desk machine," but this is not important. 
If we use the above explanation as a definition we shall be in danger of circularity of argument. We avoid this by giving an outline. of the means by which the desired effect is achieved. A digital computer can usually be regarded as consisting of three parts: 
(i) Store. 
(ii) Executive unit. 
(iii) Control. 
The store is a store of information, and corresponds to the human computer's paper, whether this is the paper on which he does his calculations or that on which his book of rules is printed. In so far as the human computer does calculations in his bead a part of the store will correspond to his memory. 
The executive unit is the part which carries out the various individual operations involved in a calculation. What these individual operations are will vary from machine to machine. Usually fairly lengthy operations can be done such as "Multiply 3540675445 by 7076345687" but in some machines only very simple ones such as "Write down 0" are possible.  
We have mentioned that the "book of rules" supplied to the computer is replaced in the machine by a part of the store. It is then called the "table of instructions." It is the duty of the control to see that these instructions are obeyed correctly and in the right order. The control is so constructed that this necessarily happens. 
The information in the store is usually broken up into packets of moderately small size. In one machine, for instance, a packet might consist of ten decimal digits. Numbers are assigned to the parts of the store in which the various packets of information are stored, in some systematic manner. A typical instruction might say- 
"Add the number stored in position 6809 to that in 4302 and put the result back into the latter storage position."  
Needless to say it would not occur in the machine expressed in English. It would more likely be coded in a form such as 6809430217. Here 17 says which of various possible 
operations is to be performed on the two numbers. In this case the)e operation is that described above, viz., "Add the number. . . ." It will be noticed that the instruction takes up 10 digits and so forms one packet of information, very conveniently. The control will normally take the instructions to be obeyed in the order of the positions in which they are stored, but occasionally an instruction such as 
"Now obey the instruction stored in position 5606, and continue from there" 
may be encountered, or again 
"If position 4505 contains 0 obey next the instruction stored in 6707, otherwise continue straight on." 
Instructions of these latter types are very important because they make it possible for a sequence of operations to be replaced over and over again until some condition is fulfilled, but in doing so to obey, not fresh instructions on each repetition, but the same ones over and over again. To take a domestic analogy. Suppose Mother wants Tommy to call at the cobbler's every morning on his way to school to see if her shoes are done, she can ask him afresh every morning. Alternatively she can stick up a notice once and for all in the hall which he will see when he leaves for school and which tells him to call for the shoes, and also to destroy the notice when he comes back if he has the shoes with him. 
The reader must accept it as a fact that digital computers can be constructed, and indeed have been constructed, according to the principles we have described, and that they can in fact mimic the actions of a human computer very closely. 
The book of rules which we have described our human computer as using is of course a convenient fiction. Actual human computers really remember what they have got to do. If one wants to make a machine mimic the behaviour of the human computer in some complex operation one has to ask him how it is done, and then translate the answer into the form of an instruction table. Constructing instruction tables is usually described as "programming." To "programme a machine to carry out the operation A" means to put the appropriate instruction table into the machine so that it will do A. 
An interesting variant on the idea of a digital computer is a "digital computer with a random element." These have instructions involving the throwing of a die or some equivalent electronic process; one such instruction might for instance be, "Throw the die and put the-resulting number into store 1000." Sometimes such a machine is described as having free will (though I would not use this phrase myself), It is not normally possible to determine from observing a machine whether it has a random element, for a similar effect can be produced by such devices as making the choices depend on the digits of the decimal for . 
Most actual digital computers have only a finite store. There is no theoretical difficulty in the idea of a computer with an unlimited store. Of course only a finite part can have been used at any one time. Likewise only a finite amount can have been constructed, but we 
can imagine more and more being added as required. Such computers have special theoretical interest and will be called infinitive capacity computers. 
The idea of a digital computer is an old one. Charles Babbage, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge from 1828 to 1839, planned such a machine, called the Analytical Engine, but it was never completed. Although Babbage had all the essential ideas, his machine was not at that time such a very attractive prospect. The speed which would have been available would be definitely faster than a human computer but something like I 00 times slower than the Manchester machine, itself one of the slower of the modern machines, The storage was to be purely mechanical, using wheels and cards. 
The fact that Babbage's Analytical Engine was to be entirely mechanical will help us to rid ourselves of a superstition. Importance is often attached to the fact that modern digital computers are electrical, and that the nervous system also is electrical. Since Babbage's machine was not electrical, and since all digital computers are in a sense equivalent, we see that this use of electricity cannot be of theoretical importance. Of course electricity usually comes in where fast signalling is concerned, so that it is not surprising that we find it in both these connections. In the nervous system chemical phenomena are at least as important as electrical. In certain computers the storage system is mainly acoustic. The feature of using electricity is thus seen to be only a very superficial similarity. If we wish to find such similarities we should took rather for mathematical analogies of function.  
5. Universality of Digital Computers 
The digital computers considered in the last section may be classified amongst the "discrete-state machines." These are the machines which move by sudden jumps or clicks from one quite definite state to another. These states are sufficiently different for the possibility of confusion between them to be ignored. Strictly speaking there, are no such machines. Everything really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine which can profitably be thought of as being discrete-state machines. For instance in considering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch must be definitely on or definitely off. There must be intermediate positions, but for most purposes we can forget about them. As an example of a discrete-state machine we might consider a wheel which clicks round through 120 once a second, but may be stopped by a ]ever which can be operated from outside; in addition a lamp is to light in one of the positions of the wheel. This machine could be described abstractly as follows. The internal state of the machine (which is described by the position of the wheel) may be q1, q2 or q3. There is an input signal i0. or i1 (position of ]ever). The internal state at any moment is determined by the last state and input signal according to the table 
(TABLE DELETED)  
The output signals, the only externally visible indication of the internal state (the light) are described by the table 
State q1 q2 q3
output o0 o0 o1
This example is typical of discrete-state machines. They can be described by such tables provided they have only a finite number of possible states. 
It will seem that given the initial state of the machine and the input signals it is always possible to predict all future states, This is reminiscent of Laplace's view that from the complete state of the universe at one moment of time, as described by the positions and velocities of all particles, it should be possible to predict all future states. The prediction which we are considering is, however, rather nearer to practicability than that considered by Laplace. The system of the "universe as a whole" is such that quite small errors in the initial conditions can have an overwhelming effect at a later time. The displacement of a single electron by a billionth of a centimetre at one moment might make the difference between a man being killed by an avalanche a year later, or escaping. It is an essential property of the mechanical systems which we have called "discrete-state machines" that this phenomenon does not occur. Even when we consider the actual physical machines instead of the idealised machines, reasonably accurate knowledge of the state at one moment yields reasonably accurate knowledge any number of steps later.  
As we have mentioned, digital computers fall within the class of discrete-state machines. But the number of states of which such a machine is capable is usually enormously large. For instance, the number for the machine now working at Manchester is about 2 165,000, i.e., about 10 50,000. Compare this with our example of the clicking wheel described above, which had three states. It is not difficult to see why the number of states should be so immense. The computer includes a store corresponding to the paper used by a human computer. It must be possible to write into the store any one of the combinations of symbols which might have been written on the paper. For simplicity suppose that only digits from 0 to 9 are used as symbols. Variations in handwriting are ignored. Suppose the computer is allowed 100 sheets of paper each containing 50 lines each with room for 30 digits. Then the number of states is 10 100x50x30 i.e., 10 150,000 . This is about the number of states of three Manchester machines put together. The logarithm to the base two of the number of states is usually called the "storage capacity" of the machine. Thus the Manchester machine has a storage capacity of about 165,000 and the wheel machine of our example about 1.6. If two machines are put together their capacities must be added to obtain the capacity of the resultant machine. This leads to the possibility of statements such as "The Manchester machine contains 64 magnetic tracks each with a capacity of 2560, eight electronic tubes with a capacity of 1280. Miscellaneous storage amounts to about 300 making a total of 174,380."  
Given the table corresponding to a discrete-state machine it is possible to predict what it will do. There is no reason why this calculation should not be carried out by means of a digital computer. Provided it could be carried out sufficiently quickly the digital computer could mimic the behavior of any discrete-state machine. The imitation game could then be played with the machine in question (as B) and the mimicking digital 
computer (as A) and the interrogator would be unable to distinguish them. Of course the digital computer must have an adequate storage capacity as well as working sufficiently fast. Moreover, it must be programmed afresh for each new machine which it is desired to mimic. 
This special property of digital computers, that they can mimic any discrete-state machine, is described by saying that they are universal machines. The existence of machines with this property has the important consequence that, considerations of speed apart, it is unnecessary to design various new machines to do various computing processes. They can all be done with one digital computer, suitably programmed for each case. It 'ill be seen that as a consequence of this all digital computers are in a sense equivalent. 
We may now consider again the point raised at the end of 3. It was suggested tentatively that the question, "Can machines think?" should be replaced by "Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?" If we wish we can make this superficially more general and ask "Are there discrete-state machines which would do well?" But in view of the universality property we see that either of these questions is equivalent to this, "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?" 
6. Contrary Views on the Main Question 
We may now consider the ground to have been cleared and we are ready to proceed to the debate on our question, "Can machines think?" and the variant of it quoted at the end of the last section. We cannot altogether abandon the original form of the problem, for opinions will differ as to the appropriateness of the substitution and we must at least listen to what has to be said in this connexion. 
It will simplify matters for the reader if I explain first my own beliefs in the matter. Consider first the more accurate form of the question. I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible, to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 109, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning. The original question, "Can machines think?" I believe to be too meaningless to deserve discussion. Nevertheless I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted. I believe further that no useful purpose is served by concealing these beliefs. The popular view that scientists proceed inexorably from well-established fact to well-established fact, never being influenced by any improved conjecture, is quite mistaken. Provided it is made clear which are proved facts and which are conjectures, no harm can result. Conjectures are of great importance since they suggest useful lines of research.  
I now proceed to consider opinions opposed to my own. 
(1) The Theological Objection 
Thinking is a function of man's immortal soul. God has given an immortal soul to every man and woman, but not to any other animal or to machines. Hence no animal or machine can think. 
I am unable to accept any part of this, but will attempt to reply in theological terms. I should find the argument more convincing if animals were classed with men, for there is a greater difference, to my mind, between the typical animate and the inanimate than there is between man and the other animals. The arbitrary character of the orthodox view becomes clearer if we consider how it might appear to a member of some other religious community. How do Christians regard the Moslem view that women have no souls? But let us leave this point aside and return to the main argument. It appears to me that the argument quoted above implies a serious restriction of the omnipotence of the Almighty. It is admitted that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one equal to two, but should we not believe that He has freedom to confer a soul on an elephant if He sees fit? We might expect that He would only exercise this power in conjunction with a mutation which provided the elephant with an appropriately improved brain to minister to the needs of this sort[. An argument of exactly similar form may be made for the case of machines. It may seem different because it is more difficult to "swallow." But this really only means that we think it would be less likely that He would consider the circumstances suitable for conferring a soul. The circumstances in question are discussed in the rest of this paper. In attempting to construct such machines we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing .mansions for the souls that He creates. 
However, this is mere speculation. I am not very impressed with theological arguments whatever they may be used to support. Such arguments have often been found unsatisfactory in the past. In the time of Galileo it was argued that the texts, "And the sun stood still . . . and hasted not to go down about a whole day" (Joshua x. 13) and "He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not move at any time" (Psalm cv. 5) were an adequate refutation of the Copernican theory. With our present knowledge such an argument appears futile. When that knowledge was not available it made a quite different impression.  
(2) The "Heads in the Sand" Objection  
The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful. Let us hope and believe that they cannot do so."  
This argument is seldom expressed quite so openly as in the form above. But it affects most of us who think about it at all. We like to believe that Man is in some subtle way superior to the rest of creation. It is best if he can be shown to be necessarily superior, for 
then there is no danger of him losing his commanding position. The popularity of the theological argument is clearly connected with this feeling. It is likely to be quite strong in intellectual people, since they value the power of thinking more highly than others, and are more inclined to base their belief in the superiority of Man on this power.  
I do not think that this argument is sufficiently substantial to require refutation. Consolation would be more appropriate: perhaps this should be sought in the transmigration of souls. 
(3) The Mathematical Objection 
There are a number of results of mathematical logic which can be used to show that there are limitations to the powers of discrete-state machines. The best known of these results is known as Godel's theorem ( 1931 ) and shows that in any sufficiently powerful logical system statements can be formulated which can neither be proved nor disproved within the system, unless possibly the system itself is inconsistent. There are other, in some respects similar, results due to Church (1936), Kleene (1935), Rosser, and Turing (1937). The latter result is the most convenient to consider, since it refers directly to machines, whereas the others can only be used in a comparatively indirect argument: for instance if Godel's theorem is to be used we need in addition to have some means of describing logical systems in terms of machines, and machines in terms of logical systems. The result in question refers to a type of machine which is essentially a digital computer with an infinite capacity. It states that there are certain things that such a machine cannot do. If it is rigged up to give answers to questions as in the imitation game, there will be some questions to which it will either give a wrong answer, or fail to give an answer at all however much time is allowed for a reply. There may, of course, be many such questions, and questions which cannot be answered by one machine may be satisfactorily answered by another. We are of course supposing for the present that the questions are of the kind to which an answer "Yes" or "No" is appropriate, rather than questions such as "What do you think of Picasso?" The questions that we know the machines must fail on are of this type, "Consider the machine specified as follows. . . . Will this machine ever answer 'Yes' to any question?" The dots are to be replaced by a description of some machine in a standard form, which could be something like that used in 5. When the machine described bears a certain comparatively simple relation to the machine which is under interrogation, it can be shown that the answer is either wrong or not forthcoming. This is the mathematical result: it is argued that it proves a disability of machines to which the human intellect is not subject. 
The short answer to this argument is that although it is established that there are limitations to the Powers If any particular machine, it has only been stated, without any sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect. But I do not think this view can be dismissed quite so lightly. Whenever one of these machines is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this feeling illusory? It is no doubt quite genuine, but I do not think too much importance should be attached to it. We too often give wrong answers to questions ourselves to be justified in being very pleased 
at such evidence of fallibility on the part of the machines. Further, our superiority can only be felt on such an occasion in relation to the one machine over which we have scored our petty triumph. There would be no question of triumphing simultaneously over all machines. In short, then, there might be men cleverer than any given machine, but then again there might be other machines cleverer again, and so on. 
Those who hold to the mathematical argument would, I think, mostly he willing to accept the imitation game as a basis for discussion, Those who believe in the two previous objections would probably not be interested in any criteria. 
(4) The Argument from Consciousness 
This argument is very, well expressed in Professor Jefferson's Lister Oration for 1949, from which I quote. "Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain-that is, not only write it but know that it had written it. No mechanism could feel (and not merely artificially signal, an easy contrivance) pleasure at its successes, grief when its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be made miserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be angry or depressed when it cannot get what it wants." 
This argument appears to be a denial of the validity of our test. According to the most extreme form of this view the only way by which one could be sure that machine thinks is to be the machine and to feel oneself thinking. One could then describe these feelings to the world, but of course no one would be justified in taking any notice. Likewise according to this view the only way to know that a man thinks is to be that particular man. It is in fact the solipsist point of view. It may be the most logical view to hold but it makes communication of ideas difficult. A is liable to believe "A thinks but B does not" whilst B believes "B thinks but A does not." instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks. 
I am sure that Professor Jefferson does not wish to adopt the extreme and solipsist point of view. Probably he would be quite willing to accept the imitation game as a test. The game (with the player B omitted) is frequently used in practice under the name of viva voce to discover whether some one really understands something or has "learnt it parrot fashion." Let us listen in to a part of such a viva voce: 
Interrogator: In the first line of your sonnet which reads "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day," would not "a spring day" do as well or better? 
Witness: It wouldn't scan. 
Interrogator: How about "a winter's day," That would scan all right. 
Witness: Yes, but nobody wants to be compared to a winter's day. 
Interrogator: Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded you of Christmas? 
Witness: In a way. 
Interrogator: Yet Christmas is a winter's day, and I do not think Mr. Pickwick would mind the comparison. 
Witness: I don't think you're serious. By a winter's day one means a typical winter's day, rather than a special one like Christmas. 
And so on, What would Professor Jefferson say if the sonnet-writing machine was able to answer like this in the viva voce? I do not know whether he would regard the machine as "merely artificially signalling" these answers, but if the answers were as satisfactory and sustained as in the above passage I do not think he would describe it as "an easy contrivance." This phrase is, I think, intended to cover such devices as the inclusion in the machine of a record of someone reading a sonnet, with appropriate switching to turn it on from time to time. 
In short then, I think that most of those who support the argument from consciousness could be persuaded to abandon it rather than be forced into the solipsist position. They will then probably be willing to accept our test. 
I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper. 
(5) Arguments from Various Disabilities 
These arguments take the form, "I grant you that you can make machines do all the things you have mentioned but you will never be able to make one to do X." Numerous features X are suggested in this connexion I offer a selection:  
Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humour, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make some one fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new. 
No support is usually offered for these statements. I believe they are mostly founded on the principle of scientific induction. A man has seen thousands of machines in his lifetime. From what he sees of them he draws a number of general conclusions. They are ugly, each is designed for a very limited purpose, when required for a minutely different purpose they are useless, the variety of behaviour of any one of them is very small, etc., etc. Naturally he concludes that these are necessary properties of machines in general. Many of these limitations are associated with the very small storage capacity of most machines. (I am assuming that the idea of storage capacity is extended in some way to 
cover machines other than discrete-state machines. The exact definition does not matter as no mathematical accuracy is claimed in the present discussion,) A few years ago, when very little had been heard of digital computers, it was possible to elicit much incredulity concerning them, if one mentioned their properties without describing their construction. That was presumably due to a similar application of the principle of scientific induction. These applications of the principle are of course largely unconscious. When a burnt child fears the fire and shows that he fears it by avoiding it, f should say that he was applying scientific induction. (I could of course also describe his behaviour in many other ways.) The works and customs of mankind do not seem to be very suitable material to which to apply scientific induction. A very large part of space-time must be investigated, if reliable results are to be obtained. Otherwise we may (as most English 'Children do) decide that everybody speaks English, and that it is silly to learn French.  
There are, however, special remarks to be made about many of the disabilities that have been mentioned. The inability to enjoy strawberries and cream may have struck the reader as frivolous. Possibly a machine might be made to enjoy this delicious dish, but any attempt to make one do so would be idiotic. What is important about this disability is that it contributes to some of the other disabilities, e.g., to the difficulty of the same kind of friendliness occurring between man and machine as between white man and white man, or between black man and black man. 
The claim that "machines cannot make mistakes" seems a curious one. One is tempted to retort, "Are they any the worse for that?" But let us adopt a more sympathetic attitude, and try to see what is really meant. I think this criticism can be explained in terms of the imitation game. It is claimed that the interrogator could distinguish the machine from the man simply by setting them a number of problems in arithmetic. The machine would be unmasked because of its deadly accuracy. The reply to this is simple. The machine (programmed for playing the game) would not attempt to give the right answers to the arithmetic problems. It would deliberately introduce mistakes in a manner calculated to confuse the interrogator. A mechanical fault would probably show itself through an unsuitable decision as to what sort of a mistake to make in the arithmetic. Even this interpretation of the criticism is not sufficiently sympathetic. But we cannot afford the space to go into it much further. It seems to me that this criticism depends on a confusion between two kinds of mistake, We may call them "errors of functioning" and "errors of conclusion." Errors of functioning are due to some mechanical or electrical fault which causes the machine to behave otherwise than it was designed to do. In philosophical discussions one likes to ignore the possibility of such errors; one is therefore discussing "abstract machines." These abstract machines are mathematical fictions rather than physical objects. By definition they are incapable of errors of functioning. In this sense we can truly say that "machines can never make mistakes." Errors of conclusion can only arise when some meaning is attached to the output signals from the machine. The machine might, for instance, type out mathematical equations, or sentences in English. When a false proposition is typed we say that the machine has committed an error of conclusion. There is clearly no reason at all for saying that a machine cannot make this kind of mistake. It might do nothing but type out repeatedly "O = I." To take a less 
perverse example, it might have some method for drawing conclusions by scientific induction. We must expect such a method to lead occasionally to erroneous results. 
The claim that a machine cannot be the subject of its own thought can of course only be answered if it can be shown that the machine has some thought with some subject matter. Nevertheless, "the subject matter of a machine's operations" does seem to mean something, at least to the people who deal with it. If, for instance, the machine was trying to find a solution of the equation x2 - 40x - 11 = 0 one would be tempted to describe this equation as part of the machine's subject matter at that moment. In this sort of sense a machine undoubtedly can be its own subject matter. It may be used to help in making up its own programmes, or to predict the effect of alterations in its own structure. By observing the results of its own behaviour it can modify its own programmes so as to achieve some purpose more effectively. These are possibilities of the near future, rather than Utopian dreams. 
The criticism that a machine cannot have much diversity of behaviour is just a way of saying that it cannot have much storage capacity. Until fairly recently a storage capacity of even a thousand digits was very rare.  
The criticisms that we are considering here are often disguised forms of the argument from consciousness, Usually if one maintains that a machine can do one of these things, and describes the kind of method that the machine could use, one will not make much of an impression. It is thought that tile method (whatever it may be, for it must be mechanical) is really rather base. Compare the parentheses in Jefferson's statement quoted on page 22. 
(6) Lady Lovelace's Objection 
Our most detailed information of Babbage's Analytical Engine comes from a memoir by Lady Lovelace ( 1842). In it she states, "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform" (her italics). This statement is quoted by Hartree ( 1949) who adds: "This does not imply that it may not be possible to construct electronic equipment which will 'think for itself,' or in which, in biological terms, one could set up a conditioned reflex, which would serve as a basis for 'learning.' Whether this is possible in principle or not is a stimulating and exciting question, suggested by some of these recent developments But it did not seem that the machines constructed or projected at the time had this property." 
I am in thorough agreement with Hartree over this. It will be noticed that he does not assert that the machines in question had not got the property, but rather that the evidence available to Lady Lovelace did not encourage her to believe that they had it. It is quite possible that the machines in question had in a sense got this property. For suppose that some discrete-state machine has the property. The Analytical Engine was a universal digital computer, so that, if its storage capacity and speed were adequate, it could by suitable programming be made to mimic the machine in question. Probably this argument 
did not occur to the Countess or to Babbage. In any case there was no obligation on them to claim all that could be claimed. 
This whole question will be considered again under the heading of learning machines. 
A variant of Lady Lovelace's objection states that a machine can "never do anything really new." This may be parried for a moment with the saw, "There is nothing new under the sun." Who can be certain that "original work" that he has done was not simply the growth of the seed planted in him by teaching, or the effect of following well-known general principles. A better variant of the objection says that a machine can never "take us by surprise." This statement is a more direct challenge and can be met directly. Machines take me by surprise with great frequency. This is largely because I do not do sufficient calculation to decide what to expect them to do, or rather because, although I do a calculation, I do it in a hurried, slipshod fashion, taking risks. Perhaps I say to myself, "I suppose the Voltage here ought to he the same as there: anyway let's assume it is." Naturally I am often wrong, and the result is a surprise for me for by the time the experiment is done these assumptions have been forgotten. These admissions lay me open to lectures on the subject of my vicious ways, but do not throw any doubt on my credibility when I testify to the surprises I experience. 
I do not expect this reply to silence my critic. He will probably say that h surprises are due to some creative mental act on my part, and reflect no credit on the machine. This leads us back to the argument from consciousness, and far from the idea of surprise. It is a line of argument we must consider closed, but it is perhaps worth remarking that the appreciation of something as surprising requires as much of a "creative mental act" whether the surprising event originates from a man, a book, a machine or anything else. 
The view that machines cannot give rise to surprises is due, I believe, to a fallacy to which philosophers and mathematicians are particularly subject. This is the assumption that as soon as a fact is presented to a mind all consequences of that fact spring into the mind simultaneously with it. It is a very useful assumption under many circumstances, but one too easily forgets that it is false. A natural consequence of doing so is that one then assumes that there is no virtue in the mere working out of consequences from data and general principles. 
(7) Argument from Continuity in the Nervous System  
The nervous system is certainly not a discrete-state machine. A small error in the information about the size of a nervous impulse impinging on a neuron, may make a large difference to the size of the outgoing impulse. It may be argued that, this being so, one cannot expect to be able to mimic the behaviour of the nervous system with a discretestate system. 
It is true that a discrete-state machine must be different from a continuous machine. But if we adhere to the conditions of the imitation game, the interrogator will not be able to take any advantage of this difference. The situation can be made clearer if we consider sonic 
other simpler continuous machine. A differential analyser will do very well. (A differential analyser is a certain kind of machine not of the discrete-state type used for some kinds of calculation.) Some of these provide their answers in a typed form, and so are suitable for taking part in the game. It would not be possible for a digital computer to predict exactly what answers the differential analyser would give to a problem, but it would be quite capable of giving the right sort of answer. For instance, if asked to give the value of (actually about 3.1416) it would be reasonable to choose at random between the values 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16 with the probabilities of 0.05, 0.15, 0.55, 0.19, 0.06 (say). Under these circumstances it would be very difficult for the interrogator to distinguish the differential analyser from the digital computer.  
(8) The Argument from Informality of Behaviour  
It is not possible to produce a set of rules purporting to describe what a man should do in every conceivable set of circumstances. One might for instance have a rule that one is to stop when one sees a red traffic light, and to go if one sees a green one, but what if by some fault both appear together? One may perhaps decide that it is safest to stop. But some further difficulty may well arise from this decision later. To attempt to provide rules of conduct to cover every eventuality, even those arising from traffic lights, appears to be impossible. With all this I agree. 
From this it is argued that we cannot be machines. I shall try to reproduce the argument, but I fear I shall hardly do it justice. It seems to run something like this. "if each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by which he regulated his life he would be no better than a machine. But there are no such rules, so men cannot be machines." The undistributed middle is glaring. I do not think the argument is ever put quite like this, but I believe this is the argument used nevertheless. There may however be a certain confusion between "rules of conduct" and "laws of behaviour" to cloud the issue. By "rules of conduct" I mean precepts such as "Stop if you see red lights," on which one can act, and of which one can be conscious. By "laws of behaviour" I mean laws of nature as applied to a man's body such as "if you pinch him he will squeak." If we substitute "laws of behaviour which regulate his life" for "laws of conduct by which he regulates his life" in the argument quoted the undistributed middle is no longer insuperable. For we believe that it is not only true that being regulated by laws of behaviour implies being some sort of machine (though not necessarily a discrete-state machine), but that conversely being such a machine implies being regulated by such laws. However, we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour as of complete rules of conduct. The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, "We have searched enough. There are no such laws." 
We can demonstrate more forcibly that any such statement would be unjustified. For suppose we could be sure of finding such laws if they existed. Then given a discrete-state machine it should certainly be possible to discover by observation sufficient about it to predict its future behaviour, and this within a reasonable time, say a thousand years. But this does not seem to be the case. I have set up on the Manchester computer a small 
programme using only 1,000 units of storage, whereby the machine supplied with one sixteen-figure number replies with another within two seconds. I would defy anyone to learn from these replies sufficient about the programme to be able to predict any replies to untried values. 
(9) The Argument from Extrasensory Perception  
I assume that the reader is familiar with the idea of extrasensory perception, and the meaning of the four items of it, viz., telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and psychokinesis. These disturbing phenomena seem to deny all our usual scientific ideas. How we should like to discredit them! Unfortunately the statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming. It is very difficult to rearrange one's ideas so as to fit these new facts in. Once one has accepted them it does not seem a very big step to believe in ghosts and bogies. The idea that our bodies move simply according to the known laws of physics, together with some others not yet discovered but somewhat similar, would be one of the first to go. 
This argument is to my mind quite a strong one. One can say in reply that many scientific theories seem to remain workable in practice, in spite of clashing with ESP; that in fact one can get along very nicely if one forgets about it. This is rather cold comfort, and one fears that thinking is just the kind of phenomenon where ESP may be especially relevant. 
A more specific argument based on ESP might run as follows: "Let us play the imitation game, using as witnesses a man who is good as a telepathic receiver, and a digital computer. The interrogator can ask such questions as 'What suit does the card in my right hand belong to?' The man by telepathy or clairvoyance gives the right answer 130 times out of 400 cards. The machine can only guess at random, and perhaps gets 104 right, so the interrogator makes the right identification." There is an interesting possibility which opens here. Suppose the digital computer contains a random number generator. Then it will be natural to use this to decide what answer to give. But then the random number generator will be subject to the psychokinetic powers of the interrogator. Perhaps this psychokinesis might cause the machine to guess right more often than would be expected on a probability calculation, so that the interrogator might still be unable to make the right identification. On the other hand, he might be able to guess right without any questioning, by clairvoyance. With ESP anything may happen. 
If telepathy is admitted it will be necessary to tighten our test up. The situation could be regarded as analogous to that which would occur if the interrogator were talking to himself and one of the competitors was listening with his ear to the wall. To put the competitors into a "telepathy-proof room" would satisfy all requirements. 
7. Learning Machines 
The reader will have anticipated that I have no very convincing arguments of a positive nature to support my views. If I had I should not have taken such pains to point out the fallacies in contrary views. Such evidence as I have I shall now give. 
Let us return for a moment to Lady Lovelace's objection, which stated that the machine can only do what we tell it to do. One could say that a man can "inject" an idea into the machine, and that it will respond to a certain extent and then drop into quiescence, like a piano string struck by a hammer. Another simile would be an atomic pile of less than critical size: an injected idea is to correspond to a neutron entering the pile from without. Each such neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventually dies away. If, however, the size of the pile is sufficiently increased, tire disturbance caused by such an incoming neutron will very likely go on and on increasing until the whole pile is destroyed. Is there a corresponding phenomenon for minds, and is there one for machines? There does seem to be one for the human mind. The majority of them seem to be "subcritical," i.e., to correspond in this analogy to piles of subcritical size. An idea presented to such a mind will on average give rise to less than one idea in reply. A smallish proportion are supercritical. An idea presented to such a mind that may give rise to a whole "theory" consisting of secondary, tertiary and more remote ideas. Animals minds seem to be very definitely subcritical. Adhering to this analogy we ask, "Can a machine be made to be supercritical?" 
The "skin-of-an-onion" analogy is also helpful. In considering the functions of the mind or the brain we find certain operations which we can explain in purely mechanical terms. This we say does not correspond to the real mind: it is a sort of skin which we must strip off if we are to find the real mind. But then in what remains we find a further skin to be stripped off, and so on. Proceeding in this way do we ever come to the "real" mind, or do we eventually come to the skin which has nothing in it? In the latter case the whole mind is mechanical. (It would not be a discrete-state machine however. We have discussed this.) 
These last two paragraphs do not claim to be convincing arguments. They should rather be described as "recitations tending to produce belief." 
The only really satisfactory support that can be given for the view expressed at the beginning of 6, will be that provided by waiting for the end of the century and then doing the experiment described. But what can we say in the meantime? What steps should be taken now if the experiment is to be successful?  
As I have explained, the problem is mainly one of programming. Advances in engineering will have to be made too, but it seems unlikely that these will not be adequate for the requirements. Estimates of the storage capacity of the brain vary from 1010 to 1015 binary digits. I incline to the lower values and believe that only a very small fraction is used for the higher types of thinking. Most of it is probably used for the retention of visual impressions, I should be surprised if more than 109 was required for satisfactory playing of the imitation game, at any rate against a blind man. (Note: The capacity of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition, is 2 X 109) A storage capacity of 107, would be a very practicable possibility even by present techniques. It is probably not necessary to increase the speed of operations of the machines at all. Parts of modern machines which can be regarded as analogs of nerve cells work about a thousand times faster than the latter. This should provide a "margin of safety" which could cover losses 
of speed arising in many ways, Our problem then is to find out how to programme these machines to play the game. At my present rate of working I produce about a thousand digits of progratiirne a day, so that about sixty workers, working steadily through the fifty years might accomplish the job, if nothing went into the wastepaper basket. Some more expeditious method seems desirable. 
In the process of trying to imitate an adult human mind we are bound to think a good deal about the process which has brought it to the state that it is in. We may notice three components. 
(a) The initial state of the mind, say at birth,  
(b) The education to which it has been subjected,  
(c) Other experience, not to be described as education, to which it has been subjected. 
Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child's? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain. Presumably the child brain is something like a notebook as one buys it from the stationer's. Rather little mechanism, and lots of blank sheets. (Mechanism and writing are from our point of view almost synonymous.) Our hope is that there is so little mechanism in the child brain that something like it can be easily programmed. The amount of work in the education we can assume, as a first approximation, to be much the same as for the human child. 
We have thus divided our problem into two parts. The child programme and the education process. These two remain very closely connected. We cannot expect to find a good child machine at the first attempt. One must experiment with teaching one such machine and see how well it learns. One can then try another and see if it is better or worse. There is an obvious connection between this process and evolution, by the identifications  
Structure of the child machine = hereditary material  
Changes of the child machine = mutation, 
Natural selection = judgment of the experimenter  
One may hope, however, that this process will be more expeditious than evolution. The survival of the fittest is a slow method for measuring advantages. The experimenter, by the exercise of intelligence, should he able to speed it up. Equally important is the fact that he is not restricted to random mutations. If he can trace a cause for some weakness he can probably think of the kind of mutation which will improve it. 
It will not be possible to apply exactly the same teaching process to the machine as to a normal child. It will not, for instance, be provided with legs, so that it could not be asked 
to go out and fill the coal scuttle. Possibly it might not have eyes. But however well these deficiencies might be overcome by clever engineering, one could not send the creature to school without the other children making excessive fun of it. It must be given some tuition. We need not be too concerned about the legs, eyes, etc. The example of Miss Helen Keller shows that education can take place provided that communication in both directions between teacher and pupil can take place by some means or other.  
We normally associate punishments and rewards with the teaching process. Some simple child machines can be constructed or programmed on this sort of principle. The machine has to be so constructed that events which shortly preceded the occurrence of a punishment signal are unlikely to be repeated, whereas a reward signal increased the probability of repetition of the events which led up to it. These definitions do not presuppose any feelings on the part of the machine, I have done some experiments with one such child machine, and succeeded in teaching it a few things, but the teaching method was too unorthodox for the experiment to be considered really successful. 
The use of punishments and rewards can at best be a part of the teaching process. Roughly speaking, if the teacher has no other means of communicating to the pupil, the amount of information which can reach him does not exceed the total number of rewards and punishments applied. By the time a child has learnt to repeat "Casabianca" he would probably feel very sore indeed, if the text could only be discovered by a "Twenty Questions" technique, every "NO" taking the form of a blow. It is necessary therefore to have some other "unemotional" channels of communication. If these are available it is possible to teach a machine by punishments and rewards to obey orders given in some language, e.g., a symbolic language. These orders are to be transmitted through the "unemotional" channels. The use of this language will diminish greatly the number of punishments and rewards required. 
Opinions may vary as to the complexity which is suitable in the child machine. One might try to make it as simple as possible consistently with the general principles. Alternatively one might have a complete system of logical inference "built in."' In the latter case the store would be largely occupied with definitions and propositions. The propositions would have various kinds of status, e.g., well-established facts, conjectures, mathematically proved theorems, statements given by an authority, expressions having the logical form of proposition but not belief-value. Certain propositions may be described as "imperatives." The machine should be so constructed that as soon as an imperative is classed as "well established" the appropriate action automatically takes place. To illustrate this, suppose the teacher says to the machine, "Do your homework now." This may cause "Teacher says 'Do your homework now' " to be included amongst the well-established facts. Another such fact might be, "Everything that teacher says is true." Combining these may eventually lead to the imperative, "Do your homework now," being included amongst the well-established facts, and this, by the construction of the machine, will mean that the homework actually gets started, but the effect is very satisfactory. The processes of inference used by the machine need not be such as would satisfy the most exacting logicians. There might for instance be no hierarchy of types. But this need not mean that type fallacies will occur, any more than we are bound to fall over 
unfenced cliffs. Suitable imperatives (expressed within the systems, not forming part of the rules of the system) such as "Do not use a class unless it is a subclass of one which has been mentioned by teacher" can have a similar effect to "Do not go too near the edge." 
The imperatives that can be obeyed by a machine that has no limbs are bound to be of a rather intellectual character, as in the example (doing homework) given above. important amongst such imperatives will be ones which regulate the order in which the rules of the logical system concerned are to be applied, For at each stage when one is using a logical system, there is a very large number of alternative steps, any of which one is permitted to apply, so far as obedience to the rules of the logical system is concerned. These choices make the difference between a brilliant and a footling reasoner, not the difference between a sound and a fallacious one. Propositions leading to imperatives of this kind might be "When Socrates is mentioned, use the syllogism in Barbara" or "If one method has been proved to be quicker than another, do not use the slower method." Some of these may be "given by authority," but others may be produced by the machine itself, e.g. by scientific induction.  
The idea of a learning machine may appear paradoxical to some readers. How can the rules of operation of the machine change? They should describe completely how the machine will react whatever its history might be, whatever changes it might undergo. The rules are thus quite time-invariant. This is quite true. The explanation of the paradox is that the rules which get changed in the learning process are of a rather less pretentious kind, claiming only an ephemeral validity. The reader may draw a parallel with the Constitution of the United States. 
An important feature of a learning machine is that its teacher will often be very largely ignorant of quite what is going on inside, although he may still be able to some extent to predict his pupil's behavior. This should apply most strongly to the later education of a machine arising from a child machine of well-tried design (or programme). This is in clear contrast with normal procedure when using a machine to do computations one's object is then to have a clear mental picture of the state of the machine at each moment in the computation. This object can only be achieved with a struggle. The view that "the machine can only do what we know how to order it to do,"' appears strange in face of this. Most of the programmes which we can put into the machine will result in its doing something that we cannot make sense (if at all, or which we regard as completely random behaviour. Intelligent behaviour presumably consists in a departure from the completely disciplined behaviour involved in computation, but a rather slight one, which does not give rise to random behaviour, or to pointless repetitive loops. Another important result of preparing our machine for its part in the imitation game by a process of teaching and learning is that "human fallibility" is likely to be omitted in a rather natural way, i.e., without special "coaching." (The reader should reconcile this with the point of view on pages 23 and 24.) Processes that are learnt do not produce a hundred per cent certainty of result; if they did they could not be unlearnt. 
It is probably wise to include a random element in a learning machine. A random element is rather useful when we are searching for a solution of some problem. Suppose for instance we wanted to find a number between 50 and 200 which was equal to the square of the sum of its digits, we might start at 51 then try 52 and go on until we got a number that worked. Alternatively we might choose numbers at random until we got a good one. This method has the advantage that it is unnecessary to keep track of the values that have been tried, but the disadvantage that one may try the same one twice, but this is not very important if there are several solutions. The systematic method has the disadvantage that there may be an enormous block without any solutions in the region which has to be investigated first, Now the learning process may be regarded as a search for a form of behaviour which will satisfy the teacher (or some other criterion). Since there is probably a very large number of satisfactory solutions the random method seems to be better than the systematic. It should be noticed that it is used in the analogous process of evolution. But there the systematic method is not possible. How could one keep track of the different genetical combinations that had been tried, so as to avoid trying them again? 
We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all purely intellectual fields. But which are the best ones to start with? Even this is a difficult decision. Many people think that a very abstract activity, like the playing of chess, would be best. It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. This process could follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc. Again I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried. 
We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.

PREFACE 
SUPPOSING that Truth is a womanwhat then? Is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists, have failed to understand womenthat the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to Truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman? Certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mienIF, indeed, it stands at all! For there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies on the groundnay more, that it is at its last gasp. But to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood WHAT has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition, which, in 
Beyond Good and Evil  
3 of 301 
the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception on the part of grammar, or an audacious generalization of very restricted, very personal, very humanall-too-human facts. The philosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be hoped, was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology in still earlier times, in the service of which probably more labour, gold, acuteness, and patience have been spent than on any actual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to its super- terrestrial pretensions in Asia and Egypt, the grand style of architecture. It seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things have first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe- inspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature of this kindfor instance, the Vedanta doctrine in Asia, and Platonism in Europe. Let us not be ungrateful to it, although it must certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome, and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist errornamely, Platos invention of Pure Spirit and the Good in Itself. But now when it has been surmounted, when Europe, rid of this nightmare, can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier

sleep, we, WHOSE DUTY IS WAKEFULNESS ITSELF, are the heirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error has fostered. It amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the denial of the PERSPECTIVEthe fundamental conditionof life, to speak of Spirit and the Good as Plato spoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: How did such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity, Plato? Had the wicked Socrates really corrupted him? Was Socrates after all a corrupter of youths, and deserved his hemlock? But the struggle against Plato, orto speak plainer, and for the peoplethe struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of Christianity (FOR CHRISITIANITY IS PLATONISM FOR THE PEOPLE), produced in Europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals. As a matter of fact, the European feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice attempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow: once by means of Jesuitism, and the second time by means of democratic enlightenmentwhich, with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it about that the spirit would not so easily find itself in distress! (The

Germans invented gunpowder-all credit to them! but they again made things squarethey invented printing.) But we, who are neither Jesuits, nor democrats, nor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD EUROPEANS, and free, VERY free spiritswe have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow! And perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and, who knows? THE GOAL TO AIM AT. Sils Maria Upper Engadine, JUNE, 1885.

CHAPTER I: PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS 
1. The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away? That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves? WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really is this Will to Truth in us? In fact we made a long halt at the question as to the origin of this Willuntil at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth presented itself before usor was it we who presented ourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. 
Beyond Good and Evil  
7 of 301 
And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk. 2. HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the generous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the wise man out of covetousness? Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams of it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest value must have a different origin, an origin of THEIR ownin this transitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source. But rather in the lap of Being, in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the Thing-in-itself THERE must be their source, and nowhere else!This mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation is at the back of all their logical procedure; through this belief of theirs, they exert themselves for their knowledge, for something that is in the end solemnly christened the Truth. The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN 
Beyond Good and Evil  
8 of 301 
ANTITHESES OF VALUES. It never occurred even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold (where doubt, however, was most necessary); though they had made a solemn vow, DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM. For it may be doubted, firstly, whether antitheses exist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their seal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely provisional perspectives, besides being probably made from some corner, perhaps from belowfrog perspectives, as it were, to borrow an expression current among painters. In spite of all the value which may belong to the true, the positive, and the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to pretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity. It might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and respected things, consists precisely in their being insidiously related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed things perhaps even in being essentially identical with them. Perhaps! But who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous Perhapses! For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of philosophers, such as 
Beyond Good and Evil  
9 of 301 
will have other tastes and inclinations, the reverse of those hitherto prevalentphilosophers of the dangerous Perhaps in every sense of the term. And to speak in all seriousness, I see such new philosophers beginning to appear. 3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between their lines long enough, I now say to myself that the greater part of conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here to learn anew, as one learned anew about heredity and innateness. As little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity, just as little is being-conscious OPPOSED to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his instincts, and forced into definite channels. And behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak more plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite mode of life For example, that the certain is worth more than the uncertain, that illusion is less valuable than truth such valuations, in spite of their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be only superficial valuations, special kinds of maiserie, such 
Beyond Good and Evil  
10 of 301 
as may be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves. Supposing, in effect, that man is not just the measure of things. 4. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life- preserving, speciespreserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable, without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not livethat the renunciation of false opinions would be a renunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil. 5. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half- distrustfully and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they arehow often and easily 
Beyond Good and Evil  
11 of 301 
they make mistakes and lose their way, in short, how childish and childlike they are,but that there is not enough honest dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner. They all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure, divinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics, who, fairer and foolisher, talk of inspiration), whereas, in fact, a prejudiced proposition, idea, or suggestion, which is generally their hearts desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with arguments sought out after the event. They are all advocates who do not wish to be regarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their prejudices, which they dub truths, and VERY far from having the conscience which bravely admits this to itself, very far from having the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be understood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful confidence and self-ridicule. The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic byways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his categorical imperative makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old 
Beyond Good and Evil  
12 of 301 
moralists and ethical preachers. Or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by means of which Spinoza has, as it were, clad his philosophy in mail and maskin fact, the love of HIS wisdom, to translate the term fairly and squarelyin order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible maiden, that Pallas Athene:how much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray! 6. It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has consisted ofnamely, the confession of its originator, and a species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover that the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown. Indeed, to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first ask oneself: What morality do they (or does he) aim at? Accordingly, I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument. But whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man 
Beyond Good and Evil  
13 of 301 
with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate LORD over all the other impulses. For every impulse is imperious, and as SUCH, attempts to philosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in the case of really scientific men, it may be otherwisebetter, if you will; there there may really be such a thing as an impulse to knowledge, some kind of small, independent clock-work, which, when well wound up, works away industriously to that end, WITHOUT the rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein. The actual interests of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another directionin the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics; it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on the contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all, his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HE 
Beyond Good and Evil  
14 of 301 
IS,that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature stand to each other. 7. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more stinging than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its original sense, and on the face of it, the word signifies Flatterers of Dionysius consequently, tyrants accessories and lick-spittles; besides this, however, it is as much as to say, They are all ACTORS, there is nothing genuine about them (for Dionysiokolax was a popular name for an actor). And the latter is really the malignant reproach that Epicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were mastersof which Epicurus was not a master! He, the old school-teacher of Samos, who sat concealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three hundred books, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who knows! Greece took a hundred years to find out who the gardengod Epicurus really was. Did she ever find out? 8. There is a point in every philosophy at which the conviction of the philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the words of an ancient mystery: Adventavit asinus, Pulcher et fortissimus.

9. You desire to LIVE according to Nature? Oh, you noble Stoics, what fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain: imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power how COULD you live in accordance with such indifference? To liveis not that just endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing, preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different? And granted that your imperative, living according to Nature, means actually the same as living according to lifehow could you do DIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature, you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stageplayers and self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist that it shall be Nature according to the Stoa, and would like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal glorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
16 of 301 
you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically, that you are no longer able to see it otherwise and to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves Stoicism is self-tyrannyNature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is not the Stoic a PART of Nature?  But this is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the will to creation of the world, the will to the causa prima. 10. The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness, with which the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with at present throughout Europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and he who hears only a Will to Truth in the background, and nothing else, cannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears. In rare and isolated cases, it may really have happened that such a Will to Trutha certain extravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysicians ambition of the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
17 of 301 
forlorn hopehas participated therein: that which in the end always prefers a handful of certainty to a whole cartload of beautiful possibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience, who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an uncertain something. But that is Nihilism, and the sign of a despairing, mortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a virtue may display. It seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. In that they side AGAINST appearance, and speak superciliously of perspective, in that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the credibility of the ocular evidence that the earth stands still, and thus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession to escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly than in ones body?),who knows if they are not really trying to win back something which was formerly an even securer possession, something of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the immortal soul, perhaps the old God, in short, ideas by which they could live better, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by modern ideas? There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this mode of looking at things, a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
18 of 301 
disbelief in all that has been constructed yesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn, which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the most varied origin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws on the market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair motleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom there is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness. Therein it seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists and knowledgemicroscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels them from MODERN reality, is unrefuted  what do their retrograde by-paths concern us! The main thing about them is NOT that they wish to go back, but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom. A little MORE strength, swing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be OFFand not back! 11. It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself. Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table of Categories; with it in his hand he said: This is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
19 of 301 
metaphysics. Let us only understand this could be! He was proud of having DISCOVERED a new faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Granting that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible somethingat all events new facultiesof which to be still prouder! But let us reflect for a momentit is high time to do so. How are synthetic judgments a priori POSSIBLE? Kant asks himselfand what is really his answer? BY MEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)but unfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of German profundity and verbal flourishes, that one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further discovered a moral faculty in manfor at that time Germans were still moral, not yet dabbling in the Politics of hard fact. Then came the honeymoon of German philosophy. All the young theologians of the Tubingen institution went immediately into the grovesall seeking for faculties. And what did they not findin that innocent, rich, and 
Beyond Good and Evil  
20 of 301 
still youthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, the malicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish between finding and inventing! Above all a faculty for the transcendental"; Schelling christened it, intellectual intuition, and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally piousinclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness, notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and senile conceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with moral indignation. Enough, howeverthe world grew older, and the dream vanished. A time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still rub them today. People had been dreaming, and first and foremostold Kant. By means of a means (faculty)he had said, or at least meant to say. But, is thatan answer? An explanation? Or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question? How does opium induce sleep? By means of a means (faculty), namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in Moliere, Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva,  Cujus est natura sensus assoupire. 
Beyond Good and Evil  
21 of 301 
But such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time to replace the Kantian question, How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI possible? by another question, Why is belief in such judgments necessary?in effect, it is high time that we should understand that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might naturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spoken, and roughly and readilysynthetic judgments a priori should not be possible at all; we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false judgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view of life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which German philosophyI hope you understand its right to inverted commas (goosefeet)?has exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to German philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, the mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the political obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the still overwhelming sensualism 
Beyond Good and Evil  
22 of 301 
which overflowed from the last century into this, in shortsensus assoupire.  12. As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best- refuted theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means of expression) thanks chiefly to the Pole Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of ocular evidence. For while Copernicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that stood fast of the earththe belief in substance, in matter, in the earth-residuum, and particle- atom: it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. One must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war to the knife, against the atomistic requirements which still lead a dangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more celebrated metaphysical requirements": one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL- 
Beyond Good and Evil  
23 of 301 
ATOMISM. Let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! Between ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul thereby, and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypothesesas happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as mortal soul, and soul of subjective multiplicity, and soul as social structure of the instincts and passions, want henceforth to have legitimate rights in science. In that the NEW psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into a new desert and a new distrustit is possible that the older psychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENTand, who knows? perhaps to DISCOVER the new. 13. Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
24 of 301 
cardinal instinct of an organic being. A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its strengthlife itself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent RESULTS thereof. In short, here, as everywhere else, let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!one of which is the instinct of self- preservation (we owe it to Spinozas inconsistency). It is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must be essentially economy of principles. 14. It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural philosophy is only a world-exposition and worldarrangement (according to us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far as it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long time to come must be regarded as morenamely, as an explanation. It has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastesin fact, it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism. What is clear, what is explained? Only that which can be seen and feltone must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, the charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an 
Beyond Good and Evil  
25 of 301 
ARISTOCRATIC mode, consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidenceperhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the sensesthe mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT different from that which the physicists of today offer us and likewise the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workers, with their principle of the smallest possible effort, and the greatest possible blunder. Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp, there is also nothing more for men to dothat is certainly an imperative different from the Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right imperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge- builders of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform. 15. To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes! Sensualism, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
26 of 301 
therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as heuristic principle. What? And others say even that the external world is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a part of this external world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is a complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the conception CAUSA SUI is something fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the external world is NOT the work of our organs? 16. There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are immediate certainties"; for instance, I think, or as the superstition of Schopenhauer puts it, I will"; as though cognition here got hold of its object purely and simply as the thing in itself, without any falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the object. I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that immediate certainty, as well as absolute knowledge and the thing in itself, involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words! The people on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the philosopher must say to himself: When I analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence, I think, I find a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
27 of 301 
whole series of daring assertions, the argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps impossible: for instance, that it is I who think, that there must necessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an ego, and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinkingthat I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already decided within myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps willing or feeling? In short, the assertion I think, assumes that I COMPARE my state at the present moment with other states of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with further knowledge, it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for me.In place of the immediate certainty in which the people may believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable conscience questions of the intellect, to wit: Whence did I get the notion of thinking? Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak of an ego, and even of an ego as cause, and finally of an ego as cause of thought? He who ventures to answer these 
Beyond Good and Evil  
28 of 301 
metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like the person who says, I think, and know that this, at least, is true, actual, and certainwill encounter a smile and two notes of interrogation in a philosopher nowadays. Sir, the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand, it is improbable that you are not mistaken, but why should it be the truth? 17. With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire of emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by these credulous minds namely, that a thought comes when it wishes, and not when I wish; so that it is a PERVERSION of the facts of the case to say that the subject I is the condition of the predicate think. ONE thinks; but that this one is precisely the famous old ego, is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an immediate certainty. After all, one has even gone too far with this one thinkseven the one contains an INTERPRETATION of the process, and does not belong to the process itself. One infers here according to the usual grammatical formulaTo think is an activity; every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently  It was pretty much on the same lines that 
Beyond Good and Evil  
29 of 301 
the older atomism sought, besides the operating power, the material particle wherein it resides and out of which it operatesthe atom. More rigorous minds, however, learnt at last to get along without this earth-residuum, and perhaps some day we shall accustom ourselves, even from the logicians point of view, to get along without the little one (to which the worthy old ego has refined itself). 18. It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the free will owes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to refute it. 19. Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and completely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing-he seems to have adopted a POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it. Willing-seems to me to be above all something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity 
Beyond Good and Evil  
30 of 301 
only in nameand it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages. So let us for once be more cautious, let us be unphilosophical": let us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations, namely, the sensation of the condition AWAY FROM WHICH we go, the sensation of the condition TOWARDS WHICH we go, the sensation of this FROM and TOWARDS itself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular sensation, which, even without our putting in motion arms and legs, commences its action by force of habit, directly we will anything. Therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place, thinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there is a ruling thought;and let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the willing, as if the will would then remain over! In the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in fact the emotion of the command. That which is termed freedom of the will is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: I am free, he must obeythis consciousness is inherent in every will; and 
Beyond Good and Evil  
31 of 301 
equally so the straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that this and nothing else is necessary now, the inward certainty that obedience will be renderedand whatever else pertains to the position of the commander. A man who WILLS commands something within himself which renders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience. But now let us notice what is the strangest thing about the will,this affair so extremely complex, for which the people have only one name. Inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term I": a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the will itself, has become attached to the act of willingto such a degree that he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action. Since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the command
Beyond Good and Evil  
32 of 301 
consequently obedience, and therefore actionwas to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success. Freedom of Willthat is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful underwills or under-soulsindeed, our body is but a social structure composed of many soulsto his feelings of delight as commander. LEFFET CEST MOI. what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed and happy commonwealth, namely, that the governing class identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as already said, of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
33 of 301 
a social structure composed of many souls, on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing- as-such within the sphere of moralsregarded as the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifests itself. 20. That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with each other, that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as the collective members of the fauna of a Continentis betrayed in the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme of POSSIBLE philosophies. Under an invisible spell, they always revolve once more in the same orbit, however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something within them leads them, something impels them in definite order the one after the otherto wit, the innate methodology and relationship of their ideas. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off, ancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly grew: 
Beyond Good and Evil  
34 of 301 
philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order. The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and German philosophizing is easily enough explained. In fact, where there is affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of grammarI mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical functionsit cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems, just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of world- interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within the domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the subject is least developed) look otherwise into the world, and will be found on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans and Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.So much by way of rejecting Lockes superficiality with regard to the origin of ideas. 21. The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with 
Beyond Good and Evil  
35 of 301 
this very folly. The desire for freedom of will in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for ones actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing less than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out in this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of free will and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry his enlightenment a step further, and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of free will": I mean non-free will, which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect. One should not wrongly MATERIALISE cause and effect, as the natural philosophers do (and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at present), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it effects its end; one should use cause and effect only as pure CONCEPTIONS, that is to say, as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual understanding,NOT for explanation. In being-in-itself there is nothing of casual- 
Beyond Good and Evil  
36 of 301 
connection, of necessity, or of psychological nonfreedom"; there the effect does NOT follow the cause, there law does not obtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence, reciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world, as being-initself, with things, we act once more as we have always actedMYTHOLOGICALLY. The non-free will is mythology; in real life it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.It is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every causalconnection and psychological necessity, manifests something of compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom; it is suspicious to have such feelingsthe person betrays himself. And in general, if I have observed correctly, the non-freedom of the will is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some will not give up their responsibility, their belief in THEMSELVES, the personal right to THEIR merits, at any price (the vain races belong to this class); others on the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
37 of 301 
no matter how. The latter, when they write books, are in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort of socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. And as a matter of fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose as la religion de la souffrance humaine"; that is ITS good taste. 22. Let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot desist from the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation, but Natures conformity to law, of which you physicists talk so proudly, as though why, it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad philology. It is no matter of fact, no text, but rather just a naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning, with which you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern soul! Everywhere equality before the lawNature is not different in that respect, nor better than we": a fine instance of secret motive, in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and autocraticlikewise a second and more refined atheismis once more disguised. Ni dieu, ni maitrethat, also, is what you want; and therefore Cheers for natural law! is it not so? But, as has been said, that is interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along, who, with opposite intentions and modes of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
38 of 301 
interpretation, could read out of the same Nature, and with regard to the same phenomena, just the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims of poweran interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and unconditionalness of all Will to Power before your eyes, that almost every word, and the word tyranny itself, would eventually seem unsuitable, or like a weakening and softening metaphoras being too human; and who should, nevertheless, end by asserting the same about this world as you do, namely, that it has a necessary and calculable course, NOT, however, because laws obtain in it, but because they are absolutely LACKING, and every power effects its ultimate consequences every moment. Granted that this also is only interpretationand you will be eager enough to make this objection?well, so much the better. 23. All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths. In so far as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written, evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent, it seems as if nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology and DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it. The power 
Beyond Good and Evil  
39 of 301 
of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most intellectual world, the world apparently most indifferent and unprejudiced, and has obviously operated in an injurious, obstructive, blinding, and distorting manner. A proper physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator, it has the heart against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the good and the bad impulses, causes (as refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong and manly consciencestill more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from bad ones. If, however, a person should regard even the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and imperiousness as lifeconditioning emotions, as factors which must be present, fundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life (which must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further developed), he will suffer from such a view of things as from sea-sickness. And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous knowledge, and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who CAN do so! On the other hand, if one has once drifted hither with ones bark, well! very good! now let us set our teeth firmly! let us open our 
Beyond Good and Evil  
40 of 301 
eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm! We sail away right OVER morality, we crush out, we destroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thitherbut what do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who thus makes a sacrificeit is not the sacrifizio dell intelletto, on the contrary!will at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences, for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist. For psychology is once more the path to the fundamental problems.

CHAPTER II: THE FREE SPIRIT 
24. O sancta simplicitiatas! In what strange simplification and falsification man lives! One can never cease wondering when once one has got eyes for beholding this marvel! How we have made everything around us clear and free and easy and simple! how we have been able to give our senses a passport to everything superficial, our thoughts a godlike desire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences!how from the beginning, we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom, thoughtlessness, imprudence, heartiness, and gaietyin order to enjoy life! And only on this solidified, granitelike foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself hitherto, the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will, the will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue! Not as its opposite, butas its refinement! It is to be hoped, indeed, that LANGUAGE, here as elsewhere, will not get over its awkwardness, and that it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees and many refinements of gradation; it is equally to be hoped that the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
42 of 301 
incarnated Tartuffery of morals, which now belongs to our unconquerable flesh and blood, will turn the words round in the mouths of us discerning ones. Here and there we understand it, and laugh at the way in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this SIMPLIFIED, thoroughly artificial, suitably imagined, and suitably falsified world: at the way in which, whether it will or not, it loves error, because, as living itself, it loves life! 25. After such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would fain be heard; it appeals to the most serious minds. Take care, ye philosophers and friends of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom! Of suffering for the truths sake! even in your own defense! It spoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience; it makes you headstrong against objections and red rags; it stupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when in the struggle with danger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even worse consequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card as protectors of truth upon earthas though the Truth were such an innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you of all people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance, Messrs Loafers and Cobwebspinners of the spirit! Finally, ye know sufficiently well 
Beyond Good and Evil  
43 of 301 
that it cannot be of any consequence if YE just carry your point; ye know that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point, and that there might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines (and occasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping games before accusers and lawcourts! Rather go out of the way! Flee into concealment! And have your masks and your ruses, that ye may be mistaken for what you are, or somewhat feared! And pray, dont forget the garden, the garden with golden trelliswork! And have people around you who are as a garden or as music on the waters at eventide, when already the day becomes a memory. Choose the GOOD solitude, the free, wanton, lightsome solitude, which also gives you the right still to remain good in any sense whatsoever! How poisonous, how crafty, how bad, does every long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means of force! How PERSONAL does a long fear make one, a long watching of enemies, of possible enemies! These pariahs of society, these long-pursued, badly-persecuted onesalso the compulsory recluses, the Spinozas or Giordano Brunosalways become in the end, even under the most intellectual masquerade, and perhaps without 
Beyond Good and Evil  
44 of 301 
being themselves aware of it, refined vengeance-seekers and poison-Brewers (just lay bare the foundation of Spinozas ethics and theology!), not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him. The martyrdom of the philosopher, his sacrifice for the sake of truth, forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him; and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity, with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration (deteriorated into a martyr, into a stage-and- tribunebawler). Only, that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any casemerely a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the continued proof that the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin. 26. Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy, where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority where he may forget men who are the rule, as their exception; exclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional 
Beyond Good and Evil

sense. Whoever, in intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy, gloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes; supposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and remains, as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then certain: he was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge. For as such, he would one day have to say to himself: The devil take my good taste! but the rule is more interesting than the exceptionthan myself, the exception! And he would go DOWN, and above all, he would go inside. The long and serious study of the AVERAGE manand consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad intercourse (all intercourse is bad intercourse except with ones equals):that constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every philosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing part. If he is fortunate, however, as a favourite child of knowledge should be, he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task; I mean so- called cynics, those who simply recognize the animal, the commonplace and the rule in themselves, and at the same time have so 
Beyond Good and Evil  
46 of 301 
much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSES sometimes they wallow, even in books, as on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him, or the scientific satyr speaks out. There are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust namely, where by a freak of nature, genius is bound to some such indiscreet billy-goat and ape, as in the case of the Abbe Galiani, the profoundest, acutest, and perhaps also filthiest man of his centuryhe was far profounder than Voltaire, and consequently also, a good deal more silent. It happens more frequently, as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an apes body, a fine exceptional understanding in a base soul, an occurrence by no means rare, especially among doctors and moral physiologists. And whenever anyone speaks without bitterness, or rather quite innocently, of man as a belly with two requirements, and a head with one; whenever any one sees, seeks, and WANTS to see only hunger, sexual instinct, and vanity as the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when any one speaks 
Beyond Good and Evil  
47 of 301 
badlyand not even illof man, then ought the lover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he ought, in general, to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation. For the indignant man, and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, God, or society), may indeed, morally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and self- satisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more ordinary, more indifferent, and less instructive case. And no one is such a LIAR as the indignant man. 27. It is difficult to be understood, especially when one thinks and lives gangasrotogati [Footnote: Like the river Ganges: presto.] among those only who think and live otherwisenamely, kurmagati [Footnote: Like the tortoise: lento.], or at best froglike, mandeikagati [Footnote: Like the frog: staccato.] (I do everything to be difficultly understood myself!)and one should be heartily grateful for the good will to some refinement of interpretation. As regards the good friends, however, who are always too easy-going, and think that as friends they have a right to ease, one does well at the very first to grant them a play-ground and romping-place for 
Beyond Good and Evil  
48 of 301 
misunderstandingone can thus laugh still; or get rid of them altogether, these good friends and laugh then also! 28. What is most difficult to render from one language into another is the TEMPO of its style, which has its basis in the character of the race, or to speak more physiologically, in the average TEMPO of the assimilation of its nutriment. There are honestly meant translations, which, as involuntary vulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the original, merely because its lively and merry TEMPO (which overleaps and obviates all dangers in word and expression) could not also be rendered. A German is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language; consequently also, as may be reasonably inferred, for many of the most delightful and daring NUANCES of free, free-spirited thought. And just as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience, so Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him. Everything ponderous, viscous, and pompously clumsy, all long-winded and wearying species of style, are developed in profuse variety among Germanspardon me for stating the fact that even Goethes prose, in its mixture of stiffness and elegance, is no exception, as a reflection of the good old time to which it belongs, and as an expression of German taste at a time when there was still a German 
Beyond Good and Evil  
49 of 301 
taste, which was a rococo-taste in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an exception, owing to his histrionic nature, which understood much, and was versed in many things; he who was not the translator of Bayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire, and still more willingly among the Roman comedy-writersLessing loved also free-spiritism in the TEMPO, and flight out of Germany. But how could the German language, even in the prose of Lessing, imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli, who in his Principe makes us breathe the dry, fine air of Florence, and cannot help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo, perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he ventures to presentlong, heavy, difficult, dangerous thoughts, and a TEMPO of the gallop, and of the best, wantonest humour? Finally, who would venture on a German translation of Petronius, who, more than any great musician hitherto, was a master of PRESTO in invention, ideas, and words? What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick, evil world, or of the ancient world, when like him, one has the feet of a wind, the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a wind, which makes everything healthy, by making everything RUN! And with regard to Aristophanesthat 
Beyond Good and Evil  
50 of 301 
transfiguring, complementary genius, for whose sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed, provided one has understood in its full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and transfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on PLATOS secrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no Bible, nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic but a book of Aristophanes. How could even Plato have endured lifea Greek life which he repudiatedwithout an Aristophanes! 29. It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor sympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go back again to the sympathy of men! 
Beyond Good and Evil  
51 of 301 
30. Our deepest insights mustand shouldappear as follies, and under certain circumstances as crimes, when they come unauthorizedly to the ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them. The exoteric and the esoteric, as they were formerly distinguished by philosophersamong the Indians, as among the Greeks, Persians, and Mussulmans, in short, wherever people believed in gradations of rank and NOT in equality and equal rightsare not so much in contradistinction to one another in respect to the exoteric class, standing without, and viewing, estimating, measuring, and judging from the outside, and not from the inside; the more essential distinction is that the class in question views things from below upwardswhile the esoteric class views things FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS. There are heights of the soul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically; and if all the woe in the world were taken together, who would dare to decide whether the sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy, and thus to a doubling of the woe?  That which serves the higher class of men for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an entirely different and lower order of human beings. The virtues of the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
52 of 301 
philosopher; it might be possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate and go to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which he would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he had sunk. There are books which have an inverse value for the soul and the health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality, or the higher and more powerful, make use of them. In the former case they are dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter case they are herald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery. Books for the general reader are always ill-smelling books, the odour of paltry people clings to them. Where the populace eat and drink, and even where they reverence, it is accustomed to stink. One should not go into churches if one wishes to breathe PURE air. 31. In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art of NUANCE, which is the best gain of life, and we have rightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with Yea and Nay. Everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes, THE TASTE FOR THE UNCONDITIONAL, is cruelly befooled and abused, until a man learns to introduce a little art into his sentiments, and prefers to try conclusions with the artificial, as do the real artists of life. The angry and 
Beyond Good and Evil  
53 of 301 
reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no peace, until it has suitably falsified men and things, to be able to vent its passion upon them: youth in itself even, is something falsifying and deceptive. Later on, when the young soul, tortured by continual disillusions, finally turns suspiciously against itselfstill ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience: how it upbraids itself, how impatiently it tears itself, how it revenges itself for its long self-blinding, as though it had been a voluntary blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of ones sentiments; one tortures ones enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the good conscience to be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and lassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all, one espouses upon principle the cause AGAINST youth.A decade later, and one comprehends that all this was also stillyouth! 32. Throughout the longest period of human history one calls it the prehistoric periodthe value or non-value of an action was inferred from its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not taken into consideration, any more than its origin; but pretty much as in China at present, where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to its parents, the retro-operating power of success or failure was what induced men to think well or 
Beyond Good and Evil  
54 of 301 
ill of an action. Let us call this period the PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, Know thyself! was then still unknown. In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand, on certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far, that one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin, decide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an important refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in origin, the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as the MORAL one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is thereby made. Instead of the consequences, the originwhat an inversion of perspective! And assuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and wavering! To be sure, an ominous new superstition, a peculiar narrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy precisely thereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite sense possible, as origin out of an INTENTION; people were agreed in the belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention. The intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action: under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed, and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to 
Beyond Good and Evil  
55 of 301 
the present day.Is it not possible, however, that the necessity may now have arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing and fundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness and acuteness in manis it not possible that we may be standing on the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be distinguished negatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when, at least among us immoralists, the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely in that which is NOT INTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness, all that is seen, sensible, or sensed in it, belongs to its surface or skin which, like every skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still more? In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom, which first requires an explanationa sign, moreover, which has too many interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone: that morality, in the sense in which it has been understood hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a prejudice, perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness, probably something of the same rank as astrology and alchemy, but in any case something which must be surmounted. The surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even the selfmounting of morality let that be the name for the long
Beyond Good and Evil  
56 of 301 
secret labour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright, and also the most wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones of the soul. 33. It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice for ones neighbour, and all self-renunciationmorality, must be mercilessly called to account, and brought to judgment; just as the aesthetics of disinterested contemplation, under which the emasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience. There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments for others and NOT for myself, for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here, and for one asking promptly: Are they not perhaps DECEPTIONS?That they PLEASE him who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and also the mere spectatorthat is still no argument in their FAVOUR, but just calls for caution. Let us therefore be cautious! 34. At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays, seen from every position, the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light upon: we find proof after proof thereof, which would fain allure us into surmises concerning a deceptive principle in the nature of things. He, however, who makes thinking 
Beyond Good and Evil  
57 of 301 
itself, and consequently the spirit, responsible for the falseness of the worldan honourable exit, which every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of he who regards this world, including space, time, form, and movement, as falsely DEDUCED, would have at least good reason in the end to become distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing upon us the worst of scurvy tricks? and what guarantee would it give that it would not continue to do what it has always been doing? In all seriousness, the innocence of thinkers has something touching and respect-inspiring in it, which even nowadays permits them to wait upon consciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answers: for example, whether it be real or not, and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at a distance, and other questions of the same description. The belief in immediate certainties is a MORAL NAIVETE which does honour to us philosophers; butwe have now to cease being MERELY moral men! Apart from morality, such belief is a folly which does little honour to us! If in middle-class life an ever- ready distrust is regarded as the sign of a bad character, and consequently as an imprudence, here among us, beyond the middle- class world and its Yeas and Nays, what should prevent our 
Beyond Good and Evil  
58 of 301 
being imprudent and saying: the philosopher has at length a RIGHT to bad character, as the being who has hitherto been most befooled on earthhe is now under OBLIGATION to distrustfulness, to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of suspicion.Forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of expression; for I myself have long ago learned to think and estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I keep at least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which philosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT? It is nothing more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the world. So much must be conceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basis of perspective estimates and semblances; and if, with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers, one wished to do away altogether with the seeming worldwell, granted that YOU could do that,at least nothing of your truth would thereby remain! Indeed, what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an essential opposition of true and false? Is it not enough to suppose degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker shades and tones of semblancedifferent valeurs, as the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
59 of 301 
painters say? Why might not the world WHICH CONCERNS USbe a fiction? And to any one who suggested: But to a fiction belongs an originator?might it not be bluntly replied: WHY? May not this belong also belong to the fiction? Is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the subject, just as towards the predicate and object? Might not the philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar? All respect to governesses, but is it not time that philosophy should renounce governess-faith? 35. O Voltaire! O humanity! O idiocy! There is something ticklish in the truth, and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes about it too humanelyil ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bienI wager he finds nothing! 36. Supposing that nothing else is given as real but our world of desires and passions, that we cannot sink or rise to any other reality but just that of our impulsesfor thinking is only a relation of these impulses to one another:are we not permitted to make the attempt and to ask the question whether this which is given does not SUFFICE, by means of our counterparts, for the understanding even of the so-called mechanical (or material) world? I do not mean as an illusion, a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
60 of 301 
semblance, a representation (in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian sense), but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions themselvesas a more primitive form of the world of emotions, in which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity, which afterwards branches off and develops itself in organic processes (naturally also, refines and debilitates)as a kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions, including self- regulation, assimilation, nutrition, secretion, and change of matter, are still synthetically united with one anotheras a PRIMARY FORM of life?In the end, it is not only permitted to make this attempt, it is commanded by the conscience of LOGICAL METHOD. Not to assume several kinds of causality, so long as the attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its furthest extent (to absurdity, if I may be allowed to say so): that is a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadaysit follows from its definition, as mathematicians say. The question is ultimately whether we really recognize the will as OPERATING, whether we believe in the causality of the will; if we do soand fundamentally our belief IN THIS is just our belief in causality itselfwe MUST make the attempt to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only 
Beyond Good and Evil  
61 of 301 
causality. Will can naturally only operate on willand not on matter (not on nerves, for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be hazarded, whether will does not operate on will wherever effects are recognizedand whether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power operates therein, is not just the power of will, the effect of will. Granted, finally, that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of willnamely, the Will to Power, as my thesis puts it; granted that all organic functions could be traced back to this Will to Power, and that the solution of the problem of generation and nutritionit is one problem could also be found therein: one would thus have acquired the right to define ALL active force unequivocally as WILL TO POWER. The world seen from within, the world defined and designated according to its intelligible characterit would simply be Will to Power, and nothing else. 37. What? Does not that mean in popular language: God is disproved, but not the devil?On the contrary! On the contrary, my friends! And who the devil also compels you to speak popularly! 38. As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times with the French Revolution (that terrible 
Beyond Good and Evil  
62 of 301 
farce, quite superfluous when judged close at hand, into which, however, the noble and visionary spectators of all Europe have interpreted from a distance their own indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately, UNTIL THE TEXT HAS DISAPPEARED UNDER THE INTERPRETATION), so a noble posterity might once more misunderstand the whole of the past, and perhaps only thereby make ITS aspect endurable.Or rather, has not this already happened? Have not we ourselves beenthat noble posterity? And, in so far as we now comprehend this, is it notthereby already past? 39. Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely because it makes people happy or virtuous excepting, perhaps, the amiable Idealists, who are enthusiastic about the good, true, and beautiful, and let all kinds of motley, coarse, and good-natured desirabilities swim about promiscuously in their pond. Happiness and virtue are no arguments. It is willingly forgotten, however, even on the part of thoughtful minds, that to make unhappy and to make bad are just as little counter- arguments. A thing could be TRUE, although it were in the highest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full knowledge of itso that the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
63 of 301 
strength of a mind might be measured by the amount of truth it could endureor to speak more plainly, by the extent to which it REQUIRED truth attenuated, veiled, sweetened, damped, and falsified. But there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain PORTIONS of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably situated and have a greater likelihood of success; not to speak of the wicked who are happya species about whom moralists are silent. Perhaps severity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development of strong, independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle, refined, yielding good-nature, and habit of taking things easily, which are prized, and rightly prized in a learned man. Presupposing always, to begin with, that the term philosopher be not confined to the philosopher who writes books, or even introduces HIS philosophy into books!Stendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the free-spirited philosopher, which for the sake of German taste I will not omit to underlinefor it is OPPOSED to German taste. Pour etre bon philosophe, says this last great psychologist, il faut etre sec, clair, sans illusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie, cest-a-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est. 
Beyond Good and Evil

40. Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest things have a hatred even of figure and likeness. Should not the CONTRARY only be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in? A question worth asking!it would be strange if some mystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing. There are proceedings of such a delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness and make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures his recollection. Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret: shame is inventive. They are not the worst things of which one is most ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask there is so much goodness in craft. I could imagine that a man with something costly and fragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his shame requiring it to be so. A man who has depths in his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach, and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friends may be 
Beyond Good and Evil  
65 of 301 
ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes, and equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature, which instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is inexhaustible in evasion of communication, DESIRES and insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his friends; and supposing he does not desire it, his eyes will some day be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him thereand that it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask; nay, more, around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask, owing to the constantly false, that is to say, SUPERFICIAL interpretation of every word he utters, every step he takes, every sign of life he manifests. 41. One must subject oneself to ones own tests that one is destined for independence and command, and do so at the right time. One must not avoid ones tests, although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous game one can play, and are in the end tests made only before ourselves and before no other judge. Not to cleave to any person, be it even the dearestevery person is a prison and also a recess. Not to cleave to a fatherland, be it even the most suffering and necessitousit is even less difficult to detach ones heart from a victorious fatherland. Not to cleave to a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
66 of 301 
sympathy, be it even for higher men, into whose peculiar torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight. Not to cleave to a science, though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries, apparently specially reserved for us. Not to cleave to ones own liberation, to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird, which always flies further aloft in order always to see more under itthe danger of the flier. Not to cleave to our own virtues, nor become as a whole a victim to any of our specialties, to our hospitality for instance, which is the danger of dangers for highly developed and wealthy souls, who deal prodigally, almost indifferently with themselves, and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes a vice. One must know how TO CONSERVE ONESELFthe best test of independence. 42. A new order of philosophers is appearing; I shall venture to baptize them by a name not without danger. As far as I understand them, as far as they allow themselves to be understoodfor it is their nature to WISH to remain something of a puzzlethese philosophers of the future might rightly, perhaps also wrongly, claim to be designated as tempters. This name itself is after all only an attempt, or, if it be preferred, a temptation. 
Beyond Good and Evil  
67 of 301 
43. Will they be new friends of truth, these coming philosophers? Very probably, for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths. But assuredly they will not be dogmatists. It must be contrary to their pride, and also contrary to their taste, that their truth should still be truth for every onethat which has hitherto been the secret wish and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts. My opinion is MY opinion: another person has not easily a right to itsuch a philosopher of the future will say, perhaps. One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people. Good is no longer good when ones neighbour takes it into his mouth. And how could there be a common good! The expression contradicts itself; that which can be common is always of small value. In the end things must be as they are and have always beenthe great things remain for the great, the abysses for the profound, the delicacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up shortly, everything rare for the rare. 44. Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free, VERY free spirits, these philosophers of the future as certainly also they will not be merely free spirits, but something more, higher, greater, and fundamentally different, which does not wish to be misunderstood and mistaken? But while I say this, I feel under 
Beyond Good and Evil  
68 of 301 
OBLIGATION almost as much to them as to ourselves (we free spirits who are their heralds and forerunners), to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding, which, like a fog, has too long made the conception of free spirit obscure. In every country of Europe, and the same in America, there is at present something which makes an abuse of this name a very narrow, prepossessed, enchained class of spirits, who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts promptnot to mention that in respect to the NEW philosophers who are appearing, they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors. Briefly and regrettably, they belong to the LEVELLERS, these wrongly named free spiritsas glib-tongued and scribefingered slaves of the democratic taste and its modern ideas all of them men without solitude, without personal solitude, blunt honest fellows to whom neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied, only, they are not free, and are ludicrously superficial, especially in their innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human misery and failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existeda notion which happily inverts the truth entirely! What they would fain attain with all their strength, is the universal, green-meadow

happiness of the herd, together with security, safety, comfort, and alleviation of life for every one, their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines are called Equality of Rights and Sympathy with All Sufferers and suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be DONE AWAY WITH. We opposite ones, however, who have opened our eye and conscience to the question how and where the plant man has hitherto grown most vigorously, believe that this has always taken place under the opposite conditions, that for this end the dangerousness of his situation had to be increased enormously, his inventive faculty and dissembling power (his spirit) had to develop into subtlety and daring under long oppression and compulsion, and his Will to Life had to be increased to the unconditioned Will to Powerwe believe that severity, violence, slavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy, stoicism, tempters art and devilry of every kind,that everything wicked, terrible, tyrannical, predatory, and serpentine in man, serves as well for the elevation of the human species as its oppositewe do not even say enough when we only say THIS MUCH, and in any case we find ourselves here, both with our speech and our silence, at the OTHER extreme of all modern 
Beyond Good and Evil  
70 of 301 
ideology and gregarious desirability, as their anti-podes perhaps? What wonder that we free spirits are not exactly the most communicative spirits? that we do not wish to betray in every respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from, and WHERE perhaps it will then be driven? And as to the import of the dangerous formula, Beyond Good and Evil, with which we at least avoid confusion, we ARE something else than libres-penseurs, liben pensatori free-thinkers, and whatever these honest advocates of modern ideas like to call themselves. Having been at home, or at least guests, in many realms of the spirit, having escaped again and again from the gloomy, agreeable nooks in which preferences and prejudices, youth, origin, the accident of men and books, or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us, full of malice against the seductions of dependency which he concealed in honours, money, positions, or exaltation of the senses, grateful even for distress and the vicissitudes of illness, because they always free us from some rule, and its prejudice, grateful to the God, devil, sheep, and worm in us, inquisitive to a fault, investigators to the point of cruelty, with unhesitating fingers for the intangible, with teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible, ready for any business that requires sagacity and acute senses, ready for

And perhaps ye are also something of the same kind, ye coming ones? ye NEW philosophers?

CHAPTER III: THE RELIGIOUS MOOD 
45. The human soul and its limits, the range of mans inner experiences hitherto attained, the heights, depths, and distances of these experiences, the entire history of the soul UP TO THE PRESENT TIME, and its still unexhausted possibilities: this is the preordained huntingdomain for a born psychologist and lover of a big hunt". But how often must he say despairingly to himself: A single individual! alas, only a single individual! and this great forest, this virgin forest! So he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistants, and fine trained hounds, that he could send into the history of the human soul, to drive HIS game together. In vain: again and again he experiences, profoundly and bitterly, how difficult it is to find assistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite his curiosity. The evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous hunting- domains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in every sense are required, is that they are no longer serviceable just when the BIG hunt, and also the great danger commences,it is precisely then that they lose their keen eye and nose. In order, for instance, to 
Beyond Good and Evil  
73 of 301 
divine and determine what sort of history the problem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE has hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi, a person would perhaps himself have to possess as profound, as bruised, as immense an experience as the intellectual conscience of Pascal; and then he would still require that wide-spread heaven of clear, wicked spirituality, which, from above, would be able to oversee, arrange, and effectively formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences.But who could do me this service! And who would have time to wait for such servants!they evidently appear too rarely, they are so improbable at all times! Eventually one must do everything ONESELF in order to know something; which means that one has MUCH to do!But a curiosity like mine is once for all the most agreeable of vices pardon me! I mean to say that the love of truth has its reward in heaven, and already upon earth. 46. Faith, such as early Christianity desired, and not infrequently achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free-spirited world, which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind it and in it, counting besides the education in tolerance which the Imperium Romanum gavethis faith is NOT that sincere, austere slave-faith by which perhaps a Luther or a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
74 of 301 
Cromwell, or some other northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God and Christianity, it is much rather the faith of Pascal, which resembles in a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reasona tough, longlived, worm-like reason, which is not to be slain at once and with a single blow. The Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the sacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit, it is at the same time subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation. There is cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith, which is adapted to a tender, many-sided, and very fastidious conscience, it takes for granted that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL, that all the past and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum, in the form of which faith comes to it. Modern men, with their obtuseness as regards all Christian nomenclature, have no longer the sense for the terribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by the paradox of the formula, God on the Cross". Hitherto there had never and nowhere been such boldness in inversion, nor anything at once so dreadful, questioning, and questionable as this formula: it promised a transvaluation of all ancient valuesIt was the Orient, the PROFOUND Orient, it was the Oriental slave who thus 
Beyond Good and Evil  
75 of 301 
took revenge on Rome and its noble, light-minded toleration, on the Roman Catholicism of non-faith, and it was always not the faith, but the freedom from the faith, the half-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith, which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against them. Enlightenment causes revolt, for the slave desires the unconditioned, he understands nothing but the tyrannous, even in morals, he loves as he hates, without NUANCE, to the very depths, to the point of pain, to the point of sicknesshis many HIDDEN sufferings make him revolt against the noble taste which seems to DENY suffering. The skepticism with regard to suffering, fundamentally only an attitude of aristocratic morality, was not the least of the causes, also, of the last great slave-insurrection which began with the French Revolution. 47. Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far, we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen: solitude, fasting, and sexual abstinencebut without its being possible to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect, or IF any relation at all of cause and effect exists there. This latter doubt is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among savage as well as among civilized peoples 
Beyond Good and Evil  
76 of 301 
is the most sudden and excessive sensuality, which then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential paroxysms, world-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy? But nowhere is it MORE obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other type seems to have been more interesting to men and even to philosophersperhaps it is time to become just a little indifferent here, to learn caution, or, better still, to look AWAY, TO GO AWAYYet in the background of the most recent philosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the problem in itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious crisis and awakening. How is the negation of will POSSIBLE? how is the saint possible?that seems to have been the very question with which Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher. And thus it was a genuine Schopenhauerian consequence, that his most convinced adherent (perhaps also his last, as far as Germany is concerned), namely, Richard Wagner, should bring his own life- work to an end just here, and should finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as Kundry, type vecu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that the mad-doctors in 
Beyond Good and Evil  
77 of 301 
almost all European countries had an opportunity to study the type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosisor as I call it, the religious moodmade its latest epidemical outbreak and display as the Salvation ArmyIf it be a question, however, as to what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages, and even to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint, it is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein namely, the immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES, of states of the soul regarded as morally antithetical: it was believed here to be self-evident that a bad man was all at once turned into a saint, a good man. The hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point, is it not possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed itself under the dominion of morals, because it BELIEVED in oppositions of moral values, and saw, read, and INTERPRETED these oppositions into the text and facts of the case? What? Miracle only an error of interpretation? A lack of philology? 48. It seems that the Latin races are far more deeply attached to their Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally, and that consequently unbelief in Catholic countries means something quite different from 
Beyond Good and Evil  
78 of 301 
what it does among Protestantsnamely, a sort of revolt against the spirit of the race, while with us it is rather a return to the spirit (or non- spirit) of the race. We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races, even as regards our talents for religion we have POOR talents for it. One may make an exception in the case of the Celts, who have theretofore furnished also the best soil for Christian infection in the North: the Christian ideal blossomed forth in France as much as ever the pale sun of the north would allow it. How strangely pious for our taste are still these later French skeptics, whenever there is any Celtic blood in their origin! How Catholic, how un-German does Auguste Comtes Sociology seem to us, with the Roman logic of its instincts! How Jesuitical, that amiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal, Sainte-Beuve, in spite of all his hostility to Jesuits! And even Ernest Renan: how inaccessible to us Northerners does the language of such a Renan appear, in whom every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refined voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance! Let us repeat after him these fine sentencesand what wickedness and haughtiness is immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful but harder souls, that is to say, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
79 of 301 
in our more German souls!DISONS DONC HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT DE LHOMME NORMAL, QUE LHOMME EST LE PLUS DANS LE VRAI QUANT IL EST LE PLUS RELIGIEUX ET LE PLUS ASSURE DUNE DESTINEE INFINIE.

These sentences are so extremely ANTIPODAL to my ears and habits of thought, that in my first impulse of rage on finding them, I wrote on the margin, LA NIAISERIE RELIGIEUSE PAR EXCELLENCE!until in my later rage I even took a fancy to them, these sentences with their truth absolutely inverted! It is so nice and such a distinction to have ones own antipodes! 49. That which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancient Greeks is the irrestrainable stream of GRATITUDE which it pours forthit is a very superior kind of man who takes SUCH an attitude towards nature 
Beyond Good and Evil  
80 of 301 
and life.Later on, when the populace got the upper hand in Greece, FEAR became rampant also in religion; and Christianity was preparing itself. 50. The passion for God: there are churlish, honesthearted, and importunate kinds of it, like that of Luther the whole of Protestantism lacks the southern DELICATEZZA. There is an Oriental exaltation of the mind in it, like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as in the case of St. Augustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive manner, all nobility in bearing and desires. There is a feminine tenderness and sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA, as in the case of Madame de Guyon. In many cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a girls or youths puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid, also as her last ambition. The Church has frequently canonized the woman in such a case. 51. The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before the saint, as the enigma of selfsubjugation and utter voluntary privationwhy did they thus bow? They divined in him and as it were behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearancethe superior force which wished to test itself 
Beyond Good and Evil  
81 of 301 
by such a subjugation; the strength of will, in which they recognized their own strength and love of power, and knew how to honour it: they honoured something in themselves when they honoured the saint. In addition to this, the contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion: such an enormity of self- negation and antinaturalness will not have been coveted for nothingthey have said, inquiringly. There is perhaps a reason for it, some very great danger, about which the ascetic might wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and visitors? In a word, the mighty ones of the world learned to have a new fear before him, they divined a new power, a strange, still unconquered enemy:it was the Will to Power which obliged them to halt before the saint. They had to question him. 52. In the Jewish Old Testament, the book of divine justice, there are men, things, and sayings on such an immense scale, that Greek and Indian literature has nothing to compare with it. One stands with fear and reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly, and one has sad thoughts about old Asia and its little out-pushed peninsula Europe, which would like, by all means, to figure before Asia as the Progress of Mankind. To be sure, he who is himself only a slender, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
82 of 301 
tame house-animal, and knows only the wants of a houseanimal (like our cultured people of today, including the Christians of cultured Christianity), need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruinsthe taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to great and small": perhaps he will find that the New Testament, the book of grace, still appeals more to his heart (there is much of the odour of the genuine, tender, stupid beadsman and petty soul in it). To have bound up this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect) along with the Old Testament into one book, as the Bible, as The Book in Itself, is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the Spirit which literary Europe has upon its conscience. 53. Why Atheism nowadays? The father in God is thoroughly refuted; equally so the judge, the rewarder. Also his free will": he does not hearand even if he did, he would not know how to help. The worst is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly; is he uncertain?This is what I have made out (by questioning and listening at a variety of conversations) to be the cause of the decline of European theism; it appears to me that though the religious instinct is in vigorous growth,it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound distrust.

54. What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartes and indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedurean ATTENTAT has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old conception of the soul, under the guise of a criticism of the subject and predicate conceptionthat is to say, an ATTENTAT on the fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine. Modern philosophy, as epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN, although (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious. Formerly, in effect, one believed in the soul as one believed in grammar and the grammatical subject: one said, I is the condition, think is the predicate and is conditionedto think is an activity for which one MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then made, with marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not get out of this net,to see if the opposite was not perhaps true: think the condition, and I the conditioned; I, therefore, only a synthesis which has been MADE by thinking itself. KANT really wished to prove that, starting from the subject, the subject could not be provednor the object either: the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the subject, and therefore of the soul, may not always have been strange to him,

the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the Vedanta philosophy. 55. There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many rounds; but three of these are the most important. Once on a time men sacrificed human beings to their God, and perhaps just those they loved the bestto this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive religions, and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the Mithra-Grotto on the Island of Capri, that most terrible of all Roman anachronisms. Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed to their God the strongest instincts they possessed, their nature"; THIS festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and antinatural fanatics. Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed? Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in future blessedness and justice? Was it not necessary to sacrifice God himself, and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone, stupidity, gravity, fate, nothingness? To sacrifice God for nothingnessthis paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the rising generation; we all know something thereof already.

56. Whoever, like myself, prompted by some enigmatical desire, has long endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it from the half-Christian, half-German narrowness and stupidity in which it has finally presented itself to this century, namely, in the form of Schopenhauers philosophy; whoever, with an Asiatic and super-Asiatic eye, has actually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of all possible modes of thoughtbeyond good and evil, and no longer like Buddha and Schopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of morality,whoever has done this, has perhaps just thereby, without really desiring it, opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal: the ideal of the most worldapproving, exuberant, and vivacious man, who has not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and is, but wishes to have it again AS IT WAS AND IS, for all eternity, insatiably calling out de capo, not only to himself, but to the whole piece and play; and not only the play, but actually to him who requires the playand makes it necessary; because he always requires himself anewand makes himself necessary.What? And this would not becirculus vitiosus deus? 57. The distance, and as it were the space around man, grows with the strength of his intellectual vision and 
Beyond Good and Evil  
86 of 301 
insight: his world becomes profounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever coming into view. Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised its acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise, something of a game, something for children and childish minds. Perhaps the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting and suffering, the conceptions God and sin, will one day seem to us of no more importance than a childs plaything or a childs pain seems to an old man; and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then be necessary once more for the old manalways childish enough, an eternal child! 58. Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or semi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for its favourite microscopic labour of selfexamination, and for its soft placidity called prayer, the state of perpetual readiness for the coming of God), I mean the idleness with a good conscience, the idleness of olden times and of blood, to which the aristocratic sentiment that work is DISHONOURINGthat it vulgarizes body and soulis not quite unfamiliar? And that consequently the modern, noisy, time-engrossing, conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for unbelief more than anything else? Among 
Beyond Good and Evil  
87 of 301 
these, for instance, who are at present living apart from religion in Germany, I find free-thinkers of diversified species and origin, but above all a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know what purpose religions serve, and only note their existence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment. They feel themselves already fully occupied, these good people, be it by their business or by their pleasures, not to mention the Fatherland, and the newspapers, and their family duties"; it seems that they have no time whatever left for religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of a new business or a new pleasurefor it is impossible, they say to themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil their tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious customs; should certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require their participation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many things are donewith a patient and unassuming seriousness, and without much curiosity or discomfort;they live too much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matters. Among those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of German Protestants of the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
88 of 301 
middle classes, especially in the great laborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious scholars, and the entire University personnel (with the exception of the theologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). On the part of pious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea of HOW MUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his whole profession (and as I have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to which he is compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the uncleanliness of spirit which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the Church. It is only with the help of history (NOT through his own personal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference in presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them, he has not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety; perhaps even the contrary. The practical 
Beyond Good and Evil  
89 of 301 
indifference to religious matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up, usually sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness, which shuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it.Every age has its own divine type of naivete, for the discovery of which other ages may envy it: and how much naiveteadorable, childlike, and boundlessly foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in his superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the religious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and ABOVE which he himself has developedhe, the little arrogant dwarf and mob-man, the sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of ideas, of modern ideas! 59. Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. It is their preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty, lightsome, and false. Here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration of pure forms in philosophers as well as in artists: it is not to be doubted that whoever has NEED of the cult of the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
90 of 301 
superficial to that extent, has at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it. Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt children, the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying to FALSIFY its image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might guess to what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which they wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and deified,one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists, as their HIGHEST rank. It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a religious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which divines that truth might be attained TOO soon, before man has become strong enough, hard enough, artist enough. Piety, the Life in God, regarded in this light, would appear as the most elaborate and ultimate product of the FEAR of truth, as artist-adoration and artist- intoxication in presence of the most logical of all falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at any price. Perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means of beautifying man than piety, by means of it man can become so artful, so superficial, so iridescent, and so good, that his appearance no longer offends.

60. To love mankind FOR GODS SAKEthis has so far been the noblest and remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained. That love to mankind, without any redeeming intention in the background, is only an ADDITIONAL folly and brutishness, that the inclination to this love has first to get its proportion, its delicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling of ambergris from a higher inclinationwhoever first perceived and experienced this, however his tongue may have stammered as it attempted to express such a delicate matter, let him for all time be holy and respected, as the man who has so far flown highest and gone astray in the finest fashion! 61. The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand himas the man of the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the general development of mankind, will use religion for his disciplining and educating work, just as he will use the contemporary political and economic conditions. The selecting and disciplining influencedestructive, as well as creative and fashioningwhich can be exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to the sort of people placed under its spell and protection. For those who are strong and independent, destined and trained to command, in whom the judgment and skill of a ruling 
Beyond Good and Evil  
92 of 301 
race is incorporated, religion is an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of authorityas a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common, betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter, their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience. And in the case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative life, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government (over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion itself may be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing GROSSER affairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE filth of all political agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood this fact. With the help of a religious organization, they secured to themselves the power of nominating kings for the people, while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside, as men with a higher and super-regal mission. At the same time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which, through fortunate marriage customs, volitional power and delight in self-control are on the increase. To them religion offers sufficient 
Beyond Good and Evil  
93 of 301 
incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and to experience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and of solitude. Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. And finally, to ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and general utility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart, ennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy, with something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of justification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all the semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with the religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually harassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it operates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner, almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it. There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity and Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to 
Beyond Good and Evil  
94 of 301 
elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough to livethis very difficulty being necessary. 62. To be sureto make also the bad counterreckoning against such religions, and to bring to light their secret dangersthe cost is always excessive and terrible when religions do NOT operate as an educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher, but rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they wish to be the final end, and not a means along with other means. Among men, as among all other animals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating, infirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful cases, among men also, are always the exception; and in view of the fact that man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare exception. But worse still. The higher the type a man represents, the greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the accidental, the law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind, manifests itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of men, the conditions of whose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult to determine. What, then, is the attitude of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
95 of 301 
the two greatest religions above-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the religions FOR SUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle; they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease, and they would fain treat every other experience of life as false and impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and preservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied, and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of man), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religionsto give a general appreciation of themare among the principal causes which have kept the type of man upon a lower levelthey have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD HAVE PERISHED. One has to thank them for invaluable services; and who is sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that the spiritual men of Christianity have done for Europe hitherto! But when they had given comfort to the sufferers, courage to the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to the helpless, and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual penitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had they to do in order to work systematically in that 
Beyond Good and Evil  
96 of 301 
fashion, and with a good conscience, for the preservation of all the sick and suffering, which means, in deed and in truth, to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE EUROPEAN RACE? To REVERSE all estimates of valueTHAT is what they had to do! And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast suspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything autonomous, manly, conquering, and imperiousall instincts which are natural to the highest and most successful type of man into uncertainty, distress of conscience, and selfdestruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy over the earth, into hatred of the earth and earthly thingsTHAT is the task the Church imposed on itself, and was obliged to impose, until, according to its standard of value, unworldliness, unsensuousness, and higher man fused into one sentiment. If one could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse and refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and impartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would never cease marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some single will has ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a SUBLIME ABORTION of man? He, however, who, with opposite requirements (no longer Epicurean) and with some divine 
Beyond Good and Evil  
97 of 301 
hammer in his hand, could approach this almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in the European Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not have to cry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: Oh, you bunglers, presumptuous pitiful bunglers, what have you done! Was that a work for your hands? How you have hacked and botched my finest stone! What have you presumed to do!I should say that Christianity has hitherto been the most portentous of presumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard enough, to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men, not sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime self- constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and perishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from man:SUCH men, with their equality before God, have hitherto swayed the destiny of Europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species has been produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly, mediocre, the European of the present day.

Knowledge for its own sakethat is the last snare laid by morality: we are thereby completely entangled in morals once more. 65. The charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has to be overcome on the way to it. 65A. We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not PERMITTED to sin. 66. The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed, deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men. 67. Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense of all others. Love to God also! 68. I did that, says my memory. I could not have done that, says my pride, and remains inexorable. Eventuallythe memory yields. 69. One has regarded life carelessly, if one has failed to see the hand thatkills with leniency.

It is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments that makes great men. 73. He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it. 73A. Many a peacock hides his tail from every eye and calls it his pride. 74. A man of genius is unbearable, unless he possess at least two things besides: gratitude and purity. 75. The degree and nature of a mans sensuality extends to the highest altitudes of his spirit. 76. Under peaceful conditions the militant man attacks himself. 77. With his principles a man seeks either to dominate, or justify, or honour, or reproach, or conceal his habits: two men with the same principles probably seek fundamentally different ends therewith. 78. He who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself thereby, as a despiser.

Where there is neither love nor hatred in the game, womans play is mediocre. 116. The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage to rebaptize our badness as the best in us. 117. The will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will of another, or of several other, emotions. 118. There is an innocence of admiration: it is possessed by him to whom it has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired some day. 119. Our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our cleaning ourselvesjustifying ourselves. 120.

The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must you allure the senses to it. 129. The devil has the most extensive perspectives for God; on that account he keeps so far away from him: the devil, in effect, as the oldest friend of knowledge. 130. What a person IS begins to betray itself when his talent decreases,when he ceases to show what he CAN do. Talent is also an adornment; an adornment is also a concealment. 131. The sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is that in reality they honour and love only themselves (or their own ideal, to express it more

In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very remarkable man. 138.

CHAPTER V: THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS 
186. The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtle, belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the Science of Morals belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered:an interesting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a moralist. Indeed, the expression, Science of Morals is, in respect to what is designated thereby, far too presumptuous and counter to GOOD taste,which is always a foretaste of more modest expressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT is still necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for the present: namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth, and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perishand perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common forms of these living crystallizationsas preparation for a THEORY OF TYPES of morality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest. All the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
113 of 301 
demanded of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science: they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality and every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself, however, has been regarded as something given. How far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problemleft in dust and decayof a description of forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough for it! It was precisely owing to moral philosophers knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary epitome, or an accidental abridgementperhaps as the morality of their environment, their position, their church, their Zeitgeist, their climate and zoneit was precisely because they were badly instructed with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means eager to know about these matters, that they did not even come in sight of the real problems of moralsproblems which only disclose themselves by a comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every Science of Morals hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything problematic there! That which philosophers called giving a basis to 
Beyond Good and Evil  
114 of 301 
morality, and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light, proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new means of its EXPRESSION, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in questionand in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and vivisecting of this very faith. Hear, for instance, with what innocencealmost worthy of honourSchopenhauer represents his own task, and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a Science whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and old wives: The principle, he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der Ethik), [Footnote: Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauers Basis of Morality, translated by Arthur B. Bullock, M.A. (1903).] the axiom about the purport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede, immo omnes quantum potes juvais REALLY the proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish,  the REAL basis of ethics which has been sought, like the philosophers stone, for centuries.The difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be greatit is well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his efforts; and whoever has thoroughly 
Beyond Good and Evil  
115 of 301 
realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is Will to Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a pessimist, ACTUALLYplayed the flute  daily after dinner: one may read about the matter in his biography. A question by the way: a pessimist, a repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES A HALT at moralitywho assents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what? Is that reallya pessimist? 187. Apart from the value of such assertions as there is a categorical imperative in us, one can always ask: What does such an assertion indicate about him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems of morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him selfsatisfied; with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others he wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction,this system of morals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something of him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant especially, gives us to understand by his morals that what is estimable in me, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
116 of 301 
is that I know how to obeyand with you it SHALL not be otherwise than with me! In short, systems of morals are only a SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS. 188. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of tyranny against nature and also against reason, that is, however, no objection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is essential and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a long constraint. In order to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal, or Puritanism, one should remember the constraint under which every language has attained to strength and freedomthe metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. How much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation given themselves!not excepting some of the prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness for the sake of a folly, as utilitarian bunglers say, and thereby deem themselves wisefrom submission to arbitrary laws, as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves free, even free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however, that everything of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and masterly certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought itself, or in 
Beyond Good and Evil  
117 of 301 
administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just as in conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary law, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely this is nature and naturaland not laisser-aller! Every artist knows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his most natural condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing, and constructing in the moments of inspirationand how strictly and delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness and precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold, and ambiguous in it). The essential thing in heaven and in earth is, apparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE in the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in the long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance, virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality anything whatever that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine. The long bondage of the spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of ideas, the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable to Aristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret 
Beyond Good and Evil  
118 of 301 
everything that happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:all this violence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness, has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has attained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility; granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled, suffocated, and spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere, nature shows herself as she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT magnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless noble). That for centuries European thinkers only thought in order to prove something-nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every thinker who wishes to prove somethingthat it was always settled beforehand what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking, as it was perhaps in the Asiatic astrology of former times, or as it is still at the present day in the innocent, Christian-moral explanation of immediate personal events for the glory of God, or for the good of the soul":this tyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent stupidity, has EDUCATED the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and the finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual education and discipline. One may look at 
Beyond Good and Evil  
119 of 301 
every system of morals in this light: it is nature therein which teaches to hate the laisser-aller, the too great freedom, and implants the need for limited horizons, for immediate dutiesit teaches the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in a certain sense, that stupidity is a condition of life and development. Thou must obey some one, and for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come to grief, and lose all respect for thyself this seems to me to be the moral imperative of nature, which is certainly neither categorical, as old Kant wished (consequently the otherwise), nor does it address itself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual!), but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all, however, to the animal man generally, to MANKIND. 189. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such an extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his weekand work-day again:as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated FAST, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although, as is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect to work). Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful influences and habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary days are 
Beyond Good and Evil  
120 of 301 
appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to hunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism, seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during which an impulse learns to humble and submit itselfat the same time also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise admit of a similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst of Hellenic culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with Aphrodisiacal odours).Here also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox, why it was precisely in the most Christian period of European history, and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiments, that the sexual impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion). 190. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might say, in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was too noble. No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done unwittingly. The evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do so, however, if he knew that evil is evil. The evil man, therefore, is only evil through error; if one free him from 
Beyond Good and Evil  
121 of 301 
error one will necessarily make himgood.This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically judge that it is STUPID to do wrong"; while they accept good as identical with useful and pleasant, without further thought. As regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err. Plato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret himself into themhe, the most daring of all interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out of the street, as a popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless and impossible modifications namely, in all his own disguises and multiplicities. In jest, and in Homeric language as well, what is the Platonic Socrates, if not [Greek words inserted here.] 191. The old theological problem of Faith and Knowledge, or more plainly, of instinct and reasonthe question whether, in respect to the valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than rationality, which wants to appreciate and act according to motives, according to a Why, that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utilityit is always the old moral problem 
Beyond Good and Evil  
122 of 301 
that first appeared in the person of Socrates, and had divided mens minds long before Christianity. Socrates himself, following, of course, the taste of his talentthat of a surpassing dialecticiantook first the side of reason; and, in fact, what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions? In the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also at himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found in himself the same difficulty and incapacity. But whyhe said to himself should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts! One must set them right, and the reason ALSOone must follow the instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments. This was the real FALSENESS of that great and mysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that he was satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived the irrationality in the moral judgment. Plato, more innocent in such matters, and without the craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to himself, at the expenditure of all his strengththe greatest strength a philosopher had ever expendedthat reason and instinct 
Beyond Good and Evil  
123 of 301 
lead spontaneously to one goal, to the good, to God"; and since Plato, all theologians and philosophers have followed the same pathwhich means that in matters of morality, instinct (or as Christians call it, Faith, or as I call it, the herd) has hitherto triumphed. Unless one should make an exception in the case of Descartes, the father of rationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution), who recognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool, and Descartes was superficial. 192. Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest processes of all knowledge and cognizance": there, as here, the premature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to belief, and the lack of distrust and patience are first developed our senses learn late, and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and cautious organs of knowledge. Our eyes find it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more force, more morality. It is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything new; we hear strange music badly. When we hear another language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into words with which we are 
Beyond Good and Evil  
124 of 301 
more familiar and conversantit was thus, for example, that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into ARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses are also hostile and averse to the new; and generally, even in the simplest processes of sensation, the emotions DOMINATEsuch as fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion of indolence.As little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words (not to speak of syllables) of a page he rather takes about five out of every twenty words at random, and guesses the probably appropriate sense to themjust as little do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to its leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so much easier to fancy the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the most remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the greater part of the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate any event, EXCEPT as inventors thereof. All this goes to prove that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have beenACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or, to express it more politely and hypocritically, in short, more pleasantlyone is much more of an artist than one is aware of.In an animated conversation, I often see the face of the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply defined before 
Beyond Good and Evil  
125 of 301 
me, according to the thought he expresses, or which I believe to be evoked in his mind, that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the STRENGTH of my visual facultythe delicacy of the play of the muscles and of the expression of the eyes MUST therefore be imagined by me. Probably the person put on quite a different expression, or none at all. 193. Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise. What we experience in dreams, provided we experience it often, pertains at last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything actually experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer, we have a requirement more or less, and finally, in broad daylight, and even in the brightest moments of our waking life, we are ruled to some extent by the nature of our dreams. Supposing that someone has often flown in his dreams, and that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable happiness; such a person, who believes that on the slightest impulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who knows the sensation of a certain divine levity, an upwards without effort or constraint, a downwards without descending or loweringwithout TROUBLE!how could the man 
Beyond Good and Evil  
126 of 301 
with such dream- experiences and dream-habits fail to find happiness differently coloured and defined, even in his waking hours! How could he failto long DIFFERENTLY for happiness? Flight, such as is described by poets, must, when compared with his own flying, be far too earthly, muscular, violent, far too troublesome for him. 194. The difference among men does not manifest itself only in the difference of their lists of desirable thingsin their regarding different good things as worth striving for, and being disagreed as to the greater or less value, the order of rank, of the commonly recognized desirable things:it manifests itself much more in what they regard as actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing. As regards a woman, for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for possession, sees the questionableness, the mere apparentness of such ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for his sake what she has or would like to have only THEN does he look upon her as possessed. A third, however, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
127 of 301 
has not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether the woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do so for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed, profoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality. One man would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts of Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose. Another, with a more refined thirst for possession, says to himself: One may not deceive where one desires to possesshe is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: I must, therefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know myself! Among helpful and charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as though, for instance, he should merit help, seek just THEIR help, and would show himself deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them for all help. With these conceits, they take control of the needy as a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
128 of 301 
property, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make something like themselves out of their childrenthey call that education"; no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is thereby her property, no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in former times fathers deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly born (as among the ancient Germans). And like the father, so also do the teacher, the class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession. The consequence is  195. The Jewsa people born for slavery, as Tacitus and the whole ancient world say of them; the chosen people among the nations, as they themselves say and believethe Jews performed the miracle of the inversion of valuations, by means of which life on earth obtained a new and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums. Their prophets fused into one the expressions rich, godless, wicked, violent, sensual, and for the first time coined the word world as a term of reproach. In this inversion of valuations (in which is also included the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
129 of 301 
use of the word poor as synonymous with saint and friend) the significance of the Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM that the SLAVEINSURRECTION IN MORALS commences. 196. It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark bodies near the sunsuch as we shall never see. Among ourselves, this is an allegory; and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star-writing merely as an allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed. 197. The beast of prey and the man of prey (for instance, Caesar Borgia) are fundamentally misunderstood, nature is misunderstood, so long as one seeks a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest of all tropical monsters and growths, or even an innate hell in themas almost all moralists have done hitherto. Does it not seem that there is a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists? And that the tropical man must be discredited at all costs, whether as disease and deterioration of mankind, or as his own hell and selftorture? And why? In favour of the temperate zones? In favour of the temperate men? The moral? The mediocre?This for the chapter: Morals as Timidity.

198. All the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to their happiness, as it is calledwhat else are they but suggestions for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in which the individuals live; recipes for their passions, their good and bad propensities, insofar as such have the Will to Power and would like to play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborations, permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wife wisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in their formbecause they address themselves to all, because they generalize where generalization is not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally, and taking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merely with one grain of salt, but rather endurable only, and sometimes even seductive, when they are over-spiced and begin to smell dangerously, especially of the other world. That is all of little value when estimated intellectually, and is far from being science, much less wisdom"; but, repeated once more, and three times repeated, it is expediency, expediency, expediency, mixed with stupidity, stupidity, stupidity whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness towards the heated folly of the emotions, which the Stoics advised and fostered; or the no- more-laughing and no
Beyond Good and Evil  
131 of 301 
more-weeping of Spinoza, the destruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection, which he recommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent mean at which they may be satisfied, the Aristotelianism of morals; or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art, perhaps as music, or as love of God, and of mankind for Gods sakefor in religion the passions are once more enfranchised, provided that  ; or, finally, even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions, as has been taught by Hafis and Goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of wise old codgers and drunkards, with whom it no longer has much danger. This also for the chapter: Morals as Timidity. 199. Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed, there have also been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples, states, churches), and always a great number who obey in proportion to the small number who commandin view, therefore, of the fact that obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto, one may reasonably suppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is now innate in every one, as a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which 
Beyond Good and Evil  
132 of 301 
gives the command Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally refrain from something, in short, Thou shalt". This need tries to satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content, according to its strength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous appetite with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into its ear by all sorts of commandersparents, teachers, laws, class prejudices, or public opinion. The extraordinary limitation of human development, the hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and turning thereof, is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of obedience is transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just as if they also were only obeying. This condition of things actually exists in Europe at presentI call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class. They know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of the law, or 
Beyond Good and Evil  
133 of 301 
of God himself), or they even justify themselves by maxims from the current opinions of the herd, as first servants of their people, or instruments of the public weal". On the other hand, the gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only kind of man that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as public spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty, indulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and useful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues. In cases, however, where it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative constitutions, for example, are of this origin. In spite of all, what a blessing, what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable, is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeansof this fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon was the last great proof the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its worthiest individuals and periods. 200. The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with one another, who has the inheritance of a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
134 of 301 
diversified descent in his bodythat is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts and standards of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom at peacesuch a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an average, be a weak man. His fundamental desire is that the war which is IN HIM should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine and mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean or Christian); it is above all things the happiness of repose, of undisturbedness, of repletion, of final unityit is the Sabbath of Sabbaths, to use the expression of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine, who was himself such a man. Should, however, the contrariety and conflict in such natures operate as an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus to lifeand if, on the other hand, in addition to their powerful and irreconcilable instincts, they have also inherited and indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict with themselves (that is to say, the faculty of self-control and selfdeception), there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and inexplicable beings, those enigmatical men, predestined for conquering and circumventing others, the finest examples of which are Alcibiades and Caesar (with whom I should like to 
Beyond Good and Evil  
135 of 301 
associate the FIRST of Europeans according to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick the Second), and among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear precisely in the same periods when that weaker type, with its longing for repose, comes to the front; the two types are complementary to each other, and spring from the same causes. 201. As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be no morality of love to ones neighbour. Granted even that there is already a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness, gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly distinguished by honourable names as virtues, and eventually almost coincide with the conception morality": in that period they do not as yet belong to the domain of moral valuationsthey are still ULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good nor bad, moral nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should it be praised, a sort of resentful 
Beyond Good and Evil  
136 of 301 
disdain is compatible with this praise, even at the best, directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES PUBLICA. After all, love to our neighbour is always a secondary matter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against external dangers, it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such as the love of enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and love of power, which up till then had not only to be honoured from the point of view of general utilityunder other names, of course, than those here givenbut had to be fostered and cultivated (because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strongwhen the outlets for them are lackingand are gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its conclusions. How much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion, a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
137 of 301 
condition, an emotion, a disposition, or an endowment that is now the moral perspective, here again fear is the mother of morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest instincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above and beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed. The lofty independent spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and honour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is always less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, the lamb, and still more the sheep, wins respect. There is a point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society itself takes the part of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
138 of 301 
him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL, and does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it to be somehow unfairit is certain that the idea of punishment and the obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people. Is it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why should we still punish? Punishment itself is terrible!with these questions gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate conclusion. If one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear, one would have done away with this morality at the same time, it would no longer be necessary, it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer necessary!Whoever examines the conscience of the present-day European, will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden recesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wish that some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR! Some time or otherthe will and the way THERETO is nowadays called progress all over Europe. 202. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred times, for peoples ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truthsOUR truths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one plainly, and 
Beyond Good and Evil  
139 of 301 
without metaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will be accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it is precisely in respect to men of modern ideas that we have constantly applied the terms herd, herd-instincts, and such like expressions. What avail is it? We cannot do otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is. We have found that in all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become unanimous, including likewise the countries where European influence prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to teachthey know today what is good and evil. It must then sound hard and be distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which here thinks it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame, and calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human animal, the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more to the front, to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts, according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS HERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and therefore, as we understand the matter, only one kind of human morality, beside which, before which, and after 
Beyond Good and Evil  
140 of 301 
which many other moralities, and above all HIGHER moralities, are or should be possible. Against such a possibility, against such a should be, however, this morality defends itself with all its strength, it says obstinately and inexorably I am morality itself and nothing else is morality! Indeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things have reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of this morality even in political and social arrangements: the DEMOCRATIC movement is the inheritance of the Christian movement. That its TEMPO, however, is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones, for those who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated by the increasingly furious howling, and always less disguised teeth- gnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now roving through the highways of European culture. Apparently in opposition to the peacefully industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and still more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity- visionaries who call themselves Socialists and want a free society, those are really at one with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
141 of 301 
extent even of repudiating the notions master and servantni dieu ni maitre, says a socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every special claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs rights any longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it were a violation of the weak, unfair to the NECESSARY consequences of all former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy, in their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the very animals, up even to Godthe extravagance of sympathy for God belongs to a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and impatience of their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering generally, in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or ALLOWING it; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening, under the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new Buddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy, as though it were morality in itself, the climax, the ATTAINED climax of mankind, the sole hope of the future, the consolation of the present, the great discharge from all the obligations of the past; 
Beyond Good and Evil  
142 of 301 
altogether at one in their belief in the community as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and therefore in themselves. 203. We, who hold a different beliefwe, who regard the democratic movement, not only as a degenerating form of political organization, but as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type of man, as involving his mediocrising and depreciation: where have WE to fix our hopes? In NEW PHILOSOPHERSthere is no other alternative: in minds strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvalue and invert eternal valuations"; in forerunners, in men of the future, who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will compel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the future of humanity as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in rearing and educating, in order thereby to put an end to the frightful rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of history (the folly of the greatest number is only its last form)for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will some time or other be needed, at the very idea of which everything that has existed in the way of occult, terrible, and benevolent beings might look pale and dwarfed. The image of such 
Beyond Good and Evil  
143 of 301 
leaders hovers before OUR eyes:is it lawful for me to say it aloud, ye free spirits? The conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for their genesis; the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a CONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values, under the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of such responsibility; and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders, the dreadful danger that they might be lacking, or miscarry and degenerate:these are OUR real anxieties and glooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits! these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of OUR life. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined, or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and deteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger of man himself DETERIORATING, he who like us has recognized the extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in respect to the future of mankinda game in which neither the hand, nor even a finger of God has participated!he who divines the fate that is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind 
Beyond Good and Evil  
144 of 301 
confidence of modern ideas, and still more under the whole of Christo-European morality-suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared. He sees at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and arrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities, and how often in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions and new paths:he knows still better from his painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become contemptible. The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of the man of the futureas idealized by the socialistic fools and shallow-patesthis degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal (or as they call it, to a man of free society), this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is undoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out this possibility to its ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest of mankindand perhaps also a new MISSION!

CHAPTER VI: WE SCHOLARS 
204. At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that which it has always beennamely, resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES, according to BalzacI would venture to protest against an improper and injurious alteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the best conscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations of science and philosophy. I mean to say that one must have the right out of ones own EXPERIENCEexperience, as it seems to me, always implies unfortunate experience?to treat of such an important question of rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST science like women and artists ("Ah! this dreadful science! sigh their instinct and their shame, it always FINDS THINGS OUT!). The declaration of independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy, is one of the subtler aftereffects of democratic organization and disorganization: the self- glorification and self-conceitedness of the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best springtimewhich does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise smells sweet. Here also the instinct of the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
146 of 301 
populace cries, Freedom from all masters! and after science has, with the happiest results, resisted theology, whose hand-maid it had been too long, it now proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for philosophy, and in its turn to play the masterwhat am I saying! to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memory the memory of a scientific man, if you please!teems with the naivetes of insolence which I have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young naturalists and old physicians (not to mention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men, the philologists and schoolmasters, who are both the one and the other by profession). On one occasion it was the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion it was the colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but a series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure which does nobody any good". At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
147 of 301 
at another time the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily extended to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most frequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars, the evil after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the whole obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid ofthe result being a general ill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to me, for instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern Germany: by his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection with German culture, which culture, all things considered, has been an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive, and un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.) On the whole, speaking generally, it may just have been the humanness, all-too-humanness of the modern philosophers themselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the populace. Let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our modern world diverges from the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
148 of 301 
whole style of the world of Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and whatever else all the royal and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called, and with what justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and origin, in view of such representatives of philosophy, who, owing to the fashion of the present day, are just as much aloft as they are down belowin Germany, for instance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist Eugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especially the sight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves realists, or positivists, which is calculated to implant a dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those philosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and specialists, that is very evident! All of them are persons who have been vanquished and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science, who at one time or another claimed more from themselves, without having a right to the more and its responsibilityand who now, creditably, rancorously, and vindictively, represent in word and deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task and supremacy of philosophy After all, how could it be otherwise? Science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible on its countenance, while that to which the entire modern 
Beyond Good and Evil  
149 of 301 
philosophy has gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the present day, excites distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to a theory of knowledge, no more in fact than a diffident science of epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even gets beyond the threshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right to enterthat is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony, something that awakens pity. How could such a philosophyRULE! 205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of the sciences have increased enormously, and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach himself somewhere and specialize so that he will no longer attain to his elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection, and his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his maturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no longer of much importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of his intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger 
Beyond Good and Evil  
150 of 301 
on the way, he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a milleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost his self-respect no longer commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should aspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and spiritual rat- catcherin short, a misleader. This is in the last instance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of conscience. To double once more the philosophers difficulties, there is also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not concerning science, but concerning life and the worth of lifehe learns unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying) experiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either with the scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously elevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and God- intoxicated man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised, because he lives wisely, or as a philosopher, it hardly means anything more than prudently and apart. Wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kind of flight, a means and artifice for 
Beyond Good and Evil  
151 of 301 
withdrawing successfully from a bad game; but the GENUINE philosopherdoes it not seem so to US, my friends?lives unphilosophically and unwisely, above all, IMPRUDENTLY, and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts and temptations of lifehe risks HIMSELF constantly, he plays THIS bad game. 206. In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either ENGENDERS or PRODUCESboth words understood in their fullest sensethe man of learning, the scientific average man, has always something of the old maid about him; for, like her, he is not conversant with the two principal functions of man. To both, of course, to the scholar and to the old maid, one concedes respectability, as if by way of indemnificationin these cases one emphasizes the respectabilityand yet, in the compulsion of this concession, one has the same admixture of vexation. Let us examine more closely: what is the scientific man? Firstly, a commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is to say, a non-ruling, nonauthoritative, and non-self-sufficient type of man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file, equability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the instinct for people like himself, and for that which they requirefor instance: the portion of independence 
Beyond Good and Evil  
152 of 301 
and green meadow without which there is no rest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration (which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability), the sunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness, with which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and again to be overcome. The learned man, as is appropriate, has also maladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and has a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations he cannot attain. He is confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go, but does not FLOW; and precisely before the man of the great current he stands all the colder and more reserved his eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake, which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy. The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results from the instinct of mediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of mediocrity, which labours instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man, and endeavours to breakor still better, to relaxevery bent bow To relax, of course, with consideration, and naturally with an indulgent handto RELAX with confiding sympathy that 
Beyond Good and Evil  
153 of 301 
is the real art of Jesuitism, which has always understood how to introduce itself as the religion of sympathy. 207. However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spiritand who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded IPSISIMOSITY!in the end, however, one must learn caution even with regard to ones gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been celebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation and glorificationas is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the highest honours to disinterested knowledge The objective man, who no longer curses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand complete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly instruments that exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful He is only an instrument, we may say, he is a MIRRORhe is no purpose in himself The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration before everything that wants to be known, with such desires only as knowing or reflecting implies he waits until something comes, and then expands himself 
Beyond Good and Evil  
154 of 301 
sensitively, so that even the light footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface and film Whatever personality he still possesses seems to him accidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms and events He calls up the recollection of himself with an effort, and not infrequently wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other persons, he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only is he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health, or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack of companions and society indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his suffering, but in vain! His thoughts already rove away to the MORE GENERAL case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how to help himself He does not now take himself seriously and devote time to himself he is serene, NOT from lack of trouble, but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences, the radiant and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that comes his way, his habit of inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous indifference as to Yea and Nay: alas! there are enough of cases in which 
Beyond Good and Evil  
155 of 301 
he has to atone for these virtues of his!and as man generally, he becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtues. Should one wish love or hatred from himI mean love and hatred as God, woman, and animal understand themhe will do what he can, and furnish what he can. But one must not be surprised if it should not be muchif he should show himself just at this point to be false, fragile, questionable, and deteriorated. His love is constrained, his hatred is artificial, and rather UNN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight ostentation and exaggeration. He is only genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totality is he still nature and natural. His mirroring and eternally selfpolishing soul no longer knows how to affirm, no longer how to deny; he does not command; neither does he destroy. JE NE MEPRISE PRESQUE RIEN he says, with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue the PRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of any one, nor after, either; he places himself generally too far off to have any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil. If he has been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER, with the Caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization, he has had far too much honour, and what is more essential in him has 
Beyond Good and Evil  
156 of 301 
been overlookedhe is an instrument, something of a slave, though certainly the sublimest sort of slave, but nothing in himselfPRESQUE RIEN! The objective man is an instrument, a costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring instrument and mirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and respected; but he is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary man in whom the REST of existence justifies itself, no termination and still less a commencement, an engendering, or primary cause, nothing hardy, powerful, self-centred, that wants to be master; but rather only a soft, inflated, delicate, movable potters- form, that must wait for some kind of content and frame to shape itself theretofor the most part a man without frame and content, a selfless man. Consequently, also, nothing for women, IN PARENTHESI. 208. When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skepticI hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the objective spirit?people all hear it impatiently; they regard him on that account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many, many questions  indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so many, he is henceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation of skepticism, it seems to 
Beyond Good and Evil  
157 of 301 
them as if they heard some evil- threatening sound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried somewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian NIHILINE, a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS, that not only denies, means denial, butdreadful thought! PRACTISES denial. Against this kind of good-willa will to the veritable, actual negation of lifethere is, as is generally acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative than skepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism; and Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an antidote to the spirit, and its underground noises. Are not our ears already full of bad sounds? say the skeptics, as lovers of repose, and almost as a kind of safety police; this subterranean Nay is terrible! Be still, ye pessimistic moles! The skeptic, in effect, that delicate creature, is far too easily frightened; his conscience is schooled so as to start at every Nay, and even at that sharp, decided Yea, and feels something like a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!they seem to him opposed to morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a festival to his virtue by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with Montaigne: What do I know? Or with Socrates: I know that I know nothing. Or: Here I do not trust myself, no door is open to me. Or: Even if 
Beyond Good and Evil  
158 of 301 
the door were open, why should I enter immediately? Or: What is the use of any hasty hypotheses? It might quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses at all. Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked? to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is there not time enough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye demons, can ye not at all WAIT? The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx, too, is a Circe, and Circe, too, was a philosopher.Thus does a skeptic console himself; and in truth he needs some consolation. For skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiological temperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and sickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been long separated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another. In the new generation, which has inherited as it were different standards and valuations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and tentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues prevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium, ballast, and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. That, however, which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the WILL; they are no longer familiar with independence of decision, or the courageous feeling 
Beyond Good and Evil  
159 of 301 
of pleasure in willingthey are doubtful of the freedom of the will even in their dreams Our present-day Europe, the scene of a senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes, and CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its heights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with gloomy aspect, like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signsand often sick unto death of its will! Paralysis of will, where do we not find this cripple sitting nowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes How seductively ornamented! There are the finest gala dresses and disguises for this disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself nowadays in the show-cases as objectiveness, the scientific spirit, LART POUR LART, and pure voluntary knowledge, is only deckedout skepticism and paralysis of willI am ready to answer for this diagnosis of the European diseaseThe disease of the will is diffused unequally over Europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization has longest prevailed, it decreases according as the barbarian stillor again asserts his claims under the loose drapery of Western culture It is therefore in the France of today, as can be readily disclosed and comprehended, that the will is most 
Beyond Good and Evil  
160 of 301 
infirm, and France, which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive, now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over Europe, by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism The power to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is already somewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the North of Germany it is stronger than in Central Germany, it is considerably stronger in England, Spain, and Corsica, associated with phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the latter not to mention Italy, which is too young yet to know what it wants, and must first show whether it can exercise will, but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle empire where Europe as it were flows back to Asianamely, in Russia There the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated, there the will uncertain whether to be negative or affirmativewaits threateningly to be discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from our physicists) Perhaps not only Indian wars and complications in Asia would be necessary to free Europe from its greatest danger, but also internal subversion, the shattering of the empire into small states, and above all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility, together with the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
161 of 301 
obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do not say this as one who desires it, in my heart I should rather prefer the contraryI mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threateningnamely, TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL, by means of a new caste to rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-out comedy of its petty-statism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close. The time for petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the dominion of the worldthe COMPULSION to great politics. 209. As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger kind of skepticism, I should like to express myself preliminarily merely by a parable, which the lovers of German history will already understand. That unscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers (who, as King of Prussia, brought into being a military and skeptical geniusand therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged type of German), the problematic, crazy father of Frederick the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
162 of 301 
Great, had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew what was then lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred times more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social formhis ill-will to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound instinct. MEN WERE LACKING; and he suspected, to his bitterest regret, that his own son was not man enough. There, however, he deceived himself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place? He saw his son lapsed to atheism, to the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of clever Frenchmenhe saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the spider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard enough either for evil or good, and of a broken will that no longer commands, is no longer ABLE to command. Meanwhile, however, there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous skepticismwho knows TO WHAT EXTENT it was encouraged just by his fathers hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to solitude?the skepticism of daring manliness, which is closely related to the genius for war and conquest, and made its first entrance into Germany in the person of the great Frederick. This skepticism despises and nevertheless grasps; 
Beyond Good and Evil  
163 of 301 
it undermines and takes possession; it does not believe, but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit a dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the heart. It is the GERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued Fredericianism, risen to the highest spirituality, has kept Europe for a considerable time under the dominion of the German spirit and its critical and historical distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character of the great German philologists and historical critics (who, rightly estimated, were also all of them artists of destruction and dissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually established itselfin spite of all Romanticism in music and philosophyin which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was decidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, as courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute will to dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized North Pole expeditions under barren and dangerous skies. There may be good grounds for it when warm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this spirit, CET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet calls it, not without a shudder. But if one would realize how characteristic is this fear of the man in the German spirit which 
Beyond Good and Evil  
164 of 301 
awakened Europe out of its dogmatic slumber, let us call to mind the former conception which had to be overcome by this new oneand that it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with unbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of Europe as gentle, goodhearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools. Finally, let us only understand profoundly enough Napoleons astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for centuries as the German spirit VOILA UN HOMME!that was as much as to say But this is a MAN! And I only expected to see a German! Supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the future, some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps be skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in them would only be designated therebyand not they themselves. With equal right they might call themselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of experiments. By the name with which I ventured to baptize them, I have already expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is this because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use of experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense? In their passion for knowledge, will they 
Beyond Good and Evil  
165 of 301 
have to go further in daring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic century can approve of?There is no doubt these coming ones will be least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as to standards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method, the wary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for selfresponsibility, indeed, they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT in denial and dissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows how to handle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds They will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves only) than humane people may desire, they will not deal with the truth in order that it may please them, or elevate and inspire themthey will rather have little faith in TRUTH bringing with it such revels for the feelings. They will smile, those rigourous spirits, when any one says in their presence That thought elevates me, why should it not be true? or That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful? or That artist enlarges me, why should he not be great? Perhaps they will not only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus rapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if 
Beyond Good and Evil  
166 of 301 
any one could look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily find therein the intention to reconcile Christian sentiments with antique taste, or even with modern parliamentarism (the kind of reconciliation necessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory century). Critical discipline, and every habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters, will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of the future, they may even make a display thereof as their special adornment nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that account. It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to have it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that philosophy itself is criticism and critical scienceand nothing else whatever! Though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of France and Germany (and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste of KANT: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works), our new philosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are instruments of the philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments, they are far from being philosophers themselves! Even the great Chinaman of Konigsberg was only a great critic. 
Beyond Good and Evil  
167 of 301 
211. I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding philosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with philosophersthat precisely here one should strictly give each his own, and not give those far too much, these far too little. It may be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants, the scientific workers of philosophy, remain standing, and MUST remain standing he himself must perhaps have been critic, and dogmatist, and historian, and besides, poet, and collector, and traveler, and riddlereader, and moralist, and seer, and free spirit, and almost everything, in order to traverse the whole range of human values and estimations, and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eyes and consciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth up to any height, from a nook into any expanse. But all these are only preliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands something elseit requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The philosophical workers, after the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel, have to fix and formalize some great existing body of valuationsthat is to say, former DETERMINATIONS OF VALUE, creations of value, which have become prevalent, and are for a time called 
Beyond Good and Evil  
168 of 301 
truthswhether in the domain of the LOGICAL, the POLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these investigators to make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto, conspicuous, conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to shorten everything long, even time itself, and to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an immense and wonderful task, in the carrying out of which all refined pride, all tenacious will, can surely find satisfaction. THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS, HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS; they say: Thus SHALL it be! They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind, and thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and all subjugators of the pastthey grasp at the future with a creative hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an instrument, and a hammer. Their knowing is CREATING, their creating is a law-giving, their will to truth isWILL TO POWER. Are there at present such philosophers? Have there ever been such philosophers? MUST there not be such philosophers some day?  212. It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever found himself, and 
Beyond Good and Evil  
169 of 301 
HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in contradiction to the day in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his day. Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one calls philosophers who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom, but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators have found their mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end, however, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of their age. In putting the vivisectors knife to the breast of the very VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been for the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a new untrodden path to his aggrandizement. They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy, indolence, self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how much virtue was OUTLIVED, they have always said We must remove hence to where YOU are least at home In the face of a world of modern ideas, which would like to confine every one in a corner, in a specialty, a philosopher, if there could be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled to place the greatness of man, the conception of greatness, precisely in his comprehensiveness and 
Beyond Good and Evil  
170 of 301 
multifariousness, in his all-roundness, he would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which a man could bear and take upon himself, according to the EXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will, nothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently, in the ideal of the philosopher, strength of will, sternness, and capacity for prolonged resolution, must specially be included in the conception of greatness, with as good a right as the opposite doctrine, with its ideal of a silly, renouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to an opposite agesuch as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its accumulated energy of will, and from the wildest torrents and floods of selfishness In the time of Socrates, among men only of worn-out instincts, old conservative Athenians who let themselves gofor the sake of happiness, as they said, for the sake of pleasure, as their conduct indicatedand who had continually on their lips the old pompous words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led, IRONY was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul, the wicked Socratic assurance of the old physician and plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh, as into the flesh and heart of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
171 of 301 
the noble, with a look that said plainly enough Do not dissemble before me! herewe are equal! At present, on the contrary, when throughout Europe the herding- animal alone attains to honours, and dispenses honours, when equality of right can too readily be transformed into equality in wrongI mean to say into general war against everything rare, strange, and privileged, against the higher man, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher responsibility, the creative plenipotence and lordlinessat present it belongs to the conception of greatness to be noble, to wish to be apart, to be capable of being different, to stand alone, to have to live by personal initiative, and the philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts He shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good and evil, the master of his virtues, and of super-abundance of will; precisely this shall be called GREATNESS: as diversified as can be entire, as ample as can be full. And to ask once more the question: Is greatness POSSIBLE nowadays? 213. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot be taught: one must know it by experienceor one should have the pride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people all talk of things of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
172 of 301 
which they CANNOT have any experience, is true more especially and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical matters:the very few know them, are permitted to know them, and all popular ideas about them are false. Thus, for instance, the truly philosophical combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace, and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step, is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience, and therefore, should any one speak of it in their presence, it is incredible to them. They conceive of every necessity as troublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint; thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating, almost as a trouble, and often enough as worthy of the SWEAT of the noblebut not at all as something easy and divine, closely related to dancing and exuberance! To think and to take a matter seriously, arduouslythat is one and the same thing to them; such only has been their experience. Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything arbitrarily, and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climaxin short, that 
Beyond Good and Evil  
173 of 301 
necessity and freedom of will are then the same thing with them. There is, in fine, a gradation of rank in psychical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality. Of what use is it for nimble, everyday intellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists to press, in their plebeian ambition, close to such problems, and as it were into this holy of holiesas so often happens nowadays! But coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is provided for in the primary law of things; the doors remain closed to those intruders, though they may dash and break their heads thereon. People have always to be born to a high station, or, more definitely, they have to be BRED for it: a person has only a right to philosophytaking the word in its higher significancein virtue of his descent; the ancestors, the blood, decide here also. Many generations must have prepared the way for the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have been separately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the bold, easy, delicate course and current of his thoughts, but above all the readiness for great responsibilities, the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
174 of 301 
majesty of ruling glance and contemning look, the feeling of separation from the multitude with their duties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever is misunderstood and calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight and practice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of will, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely loves.

CHAPTER VII: OUR VIRTUES 
214. OUR Virtues?It is probable that we, too, have still our virtues, althoughnaturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a little distance from us. We Europeans of the day after tomorrow, we firstlings of the twentieth centurywith all our dangerous curiosity, our multifariousness and art of disguising, our mellow and seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense and spiritwe shall presumably, IF we must have virtues, have those only which have come to agreement with our most secret and heartfelt inclinations, with our most ardent requirements: well, then, let us look for them in our labyrinths!where, as we know, so many things lose themselves, so many things get quite lost! And is there anything finer than to SEARCH for ones own virtues? Is it not almost to BELIEVE in ones own virtues? But this believing in ones own virtuesis it not practically the same as what was formerly called ones good conscience, that long, respectable pigtail of an idea, which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often enough also behind their understandings? It seems, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
176 of 301 
therefore, that however little we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly respectable in other respects, in one thing we are nevertheless the worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last Europeans with good consciences: we also still wear their pigtail.Ah! if you only knew how soon, so very soonit will be different! 215. As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different colours shine around a single planet, now with red light, now with green, and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley colours: so we modern men, owing to the complicated mechanism of our firmament, are determined by DIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine alternately in different colours, and are seldom unequivocaland there are often cases, also, in which our actions are MOTLEYCOLOURED. 216. To love ones enemies? I think that has been well learnt: it takes place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeed, at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place:we learn to DESPISE when we love, and precisely when we love best; all of it, however, unconsciously, without noise, without 
Beyond Good and Evil  
177 of 301 
ostentation, with the shame and secrecy of goodness, which forbids the utterance of the pompous word and the formula of virtue. Morality as attitudeis opposed to our taste nowadays. This is ALSO an advance, as it was an advance in our fathers that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste, including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion (and all that formerly belonged to freethinker- pantomime). It is the music in our conscience, the dance in our spirit, to which Puritan litanies, moral sermons, and goody- goodness wont chime. 217. Let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment! They never forgive us if they have once made a mistake BEFORE us (or even with REGARD to us)they inevitably become our instinctive calumniators and detractors, even when they still remain our friends.Blessed are the forgetful: for they get the better even of their blunders. 218. The psychologists of Franceand where else are there still psychologists nowadays?have never yet exhausted their bitter and manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise, just as though  in short, they betray something thereby. Flaubert, for instance, the honest 
Beyond Good and Evil  
178 of 301 
citizen of Rouen, neither saw, heard, nor tasted anything else in the end; it was his mode of self-torment and refined cruelty. As this is growing wearisome, I would now recommend for a change something else for a pleasure namely, the unconscious astuteness with which good, fat, honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks they have to perform, the subtle, barbed, Jesuitical astuteness, which is a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the middle-class in its best momentssubtler even than the understanding of its victims:a repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered. In short, you psychologists, study the philosophy of the rule in its struggle with the exception": there you have a spectacle fit for Gods and godlike malignity! Or, in plainer words, practise vivisection on good people, on the homo bonae voluntatis, ON YOURSELVES! 219. The practice of judging and condemning morally, is the favourite revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so, it is also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature, and finally, it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMING subtlemalice spiritualises. They are glad in their inmost 
Beyond Good and Evil  
179 of 301 
heart that there is a standard according to which those who are over-endowed with intellectual goods and privileges, are equal to them, they contend for the equality of all before God, and almost NEED the belief in God for this purpose. It is among them that the most powerful antagonists of atheism are found. If any one were to say to them A lofty spirituality is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely moral manit would make them furious, I shall take care not to say so. I would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities, that it is a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the merely moral man, after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice, perhaps during a whole series of generations, that lofty spirituality is precisely the spiritualising of justice, and the beneficent severity which knows that it is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the world, even among thingsand not only among men. 220. Now that the praise of the disinterested person is so popular one mustprobably not without some dangerget an idea of WHAT people actually take an interest in, and what are the things generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men
Beyond Good and Evil  
180 of 301 
including the cultured, even the learned, and perhaps philosophers also, if appearances do not deceive. The fact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more refined and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely uninteresting to the average manif, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these interests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to act disinterestedly. There have been philosophers who could give this popular astonishment a seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression (perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience?), instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that disinterested action is very interesting and interested action, provided that And love?What! Even an action for loves sake shall be unegoistic? But you fools! And the praise of the self- sacrificer?But whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that he wanted and obtained something for it perhaps something from himself for something from himself; that he relinquished here in order to have more there, perhaps in general to be more, or even feel himself more. But this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidious spirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to stifle her yawns so much when she is 
Beyond Good and Evil  
181 of 301 
obliged to answer. And after all, truth is a woman; one must not use force with her. 221. It sometimes happens, said a moralistic pedant and trifle- retailer, that I honour and respect an unselfish man: not, however, because he is unselfish, but because I think he has a right to be useful to another man at his own expense. In short, the question is always who HE is, and who THE OTHER is. For instance, in a person created and destined for command, self- denial and modest retirement, instead of being virtues, would be the waste of virtues: so it seems to me. Every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself unconditionally and appeals to every one, not only sins against good taste, but is also an incentive to sins of omission, an ADDITIONAL seduction under the mask of philanthropyand precisely a seduction and injury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of men. Moral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OF RANK; their presumption must be driven home to their conscienceuntil they thoroughly understand at last that it is IMMORAL to say that what is right for one is proper for another.So said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme. Did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus exhorted systems of morals to practise 
Beyond Good and Evil  
182 of 301 
morality? But one should not be too much in the right if one wishes to have the laughers on ONES OWN side; a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste. 222. Wherever sympathy (fellow-suffering) is preached nowadays and, if I gather rightly, no other religion is any longer preachedlet the psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity, through all the noise which is natural to these preachers (as to all preachers), he will hear a hoarse, groaning, genuine note of SELF-CONTEMPT. It belongs to the overshadowing and uglifying of Europe, which has been on the increase for a century (the first symptoms of which are already specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame dEpinay)IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF! The man of modern ideas, the conceited ape, is excessively dissatisfied with himself-this is perfectly certain. He suffers, and his vanity wants him only to suffer with his fellows. 223. The hybrid Europeana tolerably ugly plebeian, taken all in allabsolutely requires a costume: he needs history as a storeroom of costumes. To be sure, he notices that none of the costumes fit him properlyhe changes and changes. Let us look at the nineteenth century with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades of style, and also with respect to its moments 
Beyond Good and Evil  
183 of 301 
of desperation on account of nothing suiting us. It is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic, or classical, or Christian, or Florentine, or barocco, or national, in moribus et artibus: it does not clothe us! But the spirit, especially the historical spirit, profits even by this desperation: once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested, put on, taken off, packed up, and above all studiedwe are the first studious age in puncto of costumes, I mean as concerns morals, articles of belief, artistic tastes, and religions; we are prepared as no other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style, for the most spiritual festivallaughter and arrogance, for the transcendental height of supreme folly and Aristophanic ridicule of the world. Perhaps we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here, the domain where even we can still be original, probably as parodists of the worlds history and as Gods Merry-Andrews,perhaps, though nothing else of the present have a future, our laughter itself may have a future! 224. The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly the order of rank of the valuations according to which a people, a community, or an individual has lived, the divining instinct for the relationships of these valuations, for the relation of the authority of the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
184 of 301 
valuations to the authority of the operating forces),this historical sense, which we Europeans claim as our specialty, has come to us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi-barbarity into which Europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and racesit is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this faculty as its sixth sense. Owing to this mingling, the past of every form and mode of life, and of cultures which were formerly closely contiguous and superimposed on one another, flows forth into us modern souls"; our instincts now run back in all directions, we ourselves are a kind of chaos: in the end, as we have said, the spirit perceives its advantage therein. By means of our semi-barbarity in body and in desire, we have secret access everywhere, such as a noble age never had; we have access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations, and to every form of semi-barbarity that has at any time existed on earth; and in so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto has just been semi-barbarity, the historical sense implies almost the sense and instinct for everything, the taste and tongue for everything: whereby it immediately proves itself to be an IGNOBLE sense. For instance, we enjoy Homer once more: it is perhaps our happiest acquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
185 of 301 
whom men of distinguished culture (as the French of the seventeenth century, like Saint- Evremond, who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE, and even Voltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so easily appropriatewhom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy. The very decided Yea and Nay of their palate, their promptly ready disgust, their hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange, their horror of the bad taste even of lively curiosity, and in general the averseness of every distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desire, a dissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what is strange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards the best things of the world which are not their property or could not become their preyand no faculty is more unintelligible to such men than just this historical sense, with its truckling, plebeian curiosity. The case is not different with Shakespeare, that marvelous SpanishMoorish-Saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient Athenian of the circle of Eschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter or irritation: but weaccept precisely this wild motleyness, this medley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial, with a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
186 of 301 
refinement of art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as little disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the English populace in which Shakespeares art and taste lives, as perhaps on the Chiaja of Naples, where, with all our senses awake, we go our way, enchanted and voluntarily, in spite of the drainodour of the lower quarters of the town. That as men of the historical sense we have our virtues, is not to be disputed: we are unpretentious, unselfish, modest, brave, habituated to self-control and self-renunciation, very grateful, very patient, very complaisantbut with all this we are perhaps not very tasteful. Let us finally confess it, that what is most difficult for us men of the historical sense to grasp, feel, taste, and love, what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost hostile, is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every culture and art, the essentially noble in works and men, their moment of smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency, the goldenness and coldness which all things show that have perfected themselves. Perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste, at least to the very bad taste; and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly, hesitatingly, and with compulsion the small, short, and happy godsends and glorifications of human life as they 
Beyond Good and Evil  
187 of 301 
shine here and there: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power has voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite,when a superabundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checking and petrifying, by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still trembling ground. PROPORTIONATENESS is strange to us, let us confess it to ourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite, the immeasurable. Like the rider on his forward panting horse, we let the reins fall before the infinite, we modern men, we semi- barbariansand are only in OUR highest bliss when weARE IN MOST DANGER. 225. Whether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or eudaemonism, all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according to PLEASURE and PAIN, that is, according to accompanying circumstances and secondary considerations, are plausible modes of thought and naivetes, which every one conscious of CREATIVE powers and an artists conscience will look down upon with scorn, though not without sympathy. Sympathy for you!to be sure, that is not sympathy as you understand it: it is not sympathy for social distress, for society with its sick and misfortuned, for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie on the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
188 of 301 
ground around us; still less is it sympathy for the grumbling, vexed, revolutionary slave-classes who strive after powerthey call it freedom. OUR sympathy is a loftier and further-sighted sympathy:we see how MAN dwarfs himself, how YOU dwarf him! and there are moments when we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish, when we resist it,when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind of levity. You want, if possibleand there is not a more foolish if possible TO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING; and we?it really seems that WE would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been! Well-being, as you understand itis certainly not a goal; it seems to us an END; a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and contemptibleand makes his destruction DESIRABLE! The discipline of suffering, of GREAT sufferingknow ye not that it is only THIS discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto? The tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energy, its shuddering in view of rack and ruin, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, enduring, interpreting, and exploiting misfortune, and whatever depth, mystery, disguise, spirit, artifice, or greatness has been bestowed upon the soulhas it not 
Beyond Good and Evil  
189 of 301 
been bestowed through suffering, through the discipline of great suffering? In man CREATURE and CREATOR are united: in man there is not only matter, shred, excess, clay, mire, folly, chaos; but there is also the creator, the sculptor, the hardness of the hammer, the divinity of the spectator, and the seventh daydo ye understand this contrast? And that YOUR sympathy for the creature in man applies to that which has to be fashioned, bruised, forged, stretched, roasted, annealed, refinedto that which must necessarily SUFFER, and IS MEANT to suffer? And our sympathydo ye not understand what our REVERSE sympathy applies to, when it resists your sympathy as the worst of all pampering and enervation? So it is sympathy AGAINST sympathy!But to repeat it once more, there are higher problems than the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy; and all systems of philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes. 226. WE IMMORALISTS.-This world with which WE are concerned, in which we have to fear and love, this almost invisible, inaudible world of delicate command and delicate obedience, a world of almost in every respect, captious, insidious, sharp, and tenderyes, it is well protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity! We are woven into a strong net and garment of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
190 of 301 
duties, and CANNOT disengage ourselvesprecisely here, we are men of duty, even we! Occasionally, it is true, we dance in our chains and betwixt our swords"; it is none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under the circumstances, and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot. But do what we will, fools and appearances say of us: These are men WITHOUT duty, we have always fools and appearances against us! 227. Honesty, granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot rid ourselves, we free spiritswell, we will labour at it with all our perversity and love, and not tire of perfecting ourselves in OUR virtue, which alone remains: may its glance some day overspread like a gilded, blue, mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull gloomy seriousness! And if, nevertheless, our honesty should one day grow weary, and sigh, and stretch its limbs, and find us too hard, and would fain have it pleasanter, easier, and gentler, like an agreeable vice, let us remain HARD, we latest Stoics, and let us send to its help whatever devilry we have in us:our disgust at the clumsy and undefined, our NITIMUR IN VETITUM, our love of adventure, our sharpened and fastidious curiosity, our most subtle, disguised, intellectual Will to Power and universal conquest, which rambles and roves 
Beyond Good and Evil  
191 of 301 
avidiously around all the realms of the futurelet us go with all our devils to the help of our God! It is probable that people will misunderstand and mistake us on that account: what does it matter! They will say: Their honestythat is their devilry, and nothing else! What does it matter! And even if they were righthave not all Gods hitherto been such sanctified, re-baptized devils? And after all, what do we know of ourselves? And what the spirit that leads us wants TO BE CALLED? (It is a question of names.) And how many spirits we harbour? Our honesty, we free spiritslet us be careful lest it become our vanity, our ornament and ostentation, our limitation, our stupidity! Every virtue inclines to stupidity, every stupidity to virtue; stupid to the point of sanctity, they say in Russia, let us be careful lest out of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores! Is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves? One would have to believe in eternal life in order to  228. I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific appliancesand that virtue, in my opinion, has been MORE injured by the TEDIOUSNESS of its advocates than by anything else; at the same time, however, I would not wish to overlook their general 
Beyond Good and Evil  
192 of 301 
usefulness. It is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals, and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day become interesting! But let us not be afraid! Things still remain today as they have always been: I see no one in Europe who has (or DISCLOSES) an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be conducted in a dangerous, captious, and ensnaring mannerthat CALAMITY might be involved therein. Observe, for example, the indefatigable, inevitable English utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably they stalk on, stalk along (a Homeric metaphor expresses it better) in the footsteps of Bentham, just as he had already stalked in the footsteps of the respectable Helvetius! (no, he was not a dangerous man, Helvetius, CE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE, to use an expression of Galiani). No new thought, nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression of an old thought, not even a proper history of what has been previously thought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE literature, taking it all in all, unless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief. In effect, the old English vice called CANT, which is MORAL TARTUFFISM, has insinuated itself also into these moralists (whom one must certainly read with an eye to their motives if one 
Beyond Good and Evil  
193 of 301 
MUST read them), concealed this time under the new form of the scientific spirit; moreover, there is not absent from them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience, from which a race of former Puritans must naturally suffer, in all their scientific tinkering with morals. (Is not a moralist the opposite of a Puritan? That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable, as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem? Is moralizing notimmoral?) In the end, they all want English morality to be recognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the general utility, or the happiness of the greatest number,no! the happiness of ENGLAND, will be best served thereby. They would like, by all means, to convince themselves that the striving after English happiness, I mean after COMFORT and FASHION (and in the highest instance, a seat in Parliament), is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact, that in so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has just consisted in such striving. Not one of those ponderous, consciencestricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to have any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the general welfare is no ideal, no goal, no notion that can be at all grasped, but is only a nostrum,that what is fair to 
Beyond Good and Evil  
194 of 301 
one MAY NOT at all be fair to another, that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to higher men, in short, that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man and man, and consequently between morality and morality. They are an unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian Englishmen, and, as already remarked, in so far as they are tedious, one cannot think highly enough of their utility. One ought even to ENCOURAGE them, as has been partially attempted in the following rhymes: Hail, ye worthies, barrow-wheeling, Longerbetter, aye revealing, Stiffer aye in head and knee;  Unenraptured, never jesting, Mediocre everlasting, SANS GENIE ET SANS ESPRIT! 229. In these later ages, which may be proud of their humanity, there still remains so much fear, so much SUPERSTITION of the fear, of the cruel wild beast, the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of these humaner agesthat even obvious truths, as if by the agreement of centuries, have long remained unuttered, because they have the appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again. I perhaps risk something 
Beyond Good and Evil  
195 of 301 
when I allow such a truth to escape; let others capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentiment [FOOTNOTE: An expression from Schillers William Tell, Act IV, Scene 3.] to drink, that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in its old corner.One ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open ones eyes; one ought at last to learn impatience, in order that such immodest gross errorsas, for instance, have been fostered by ancient and modern philosophers with regard to tragedymay no longer wander about virtuously and boldly. Almost everything that we call higher culture is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTYthis is my thesis; the wild beast has not been slain at all, it lives, it flourishes, it has only been transfigured. That which constitutes the painful delight of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in so-called tragic sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime, up to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains its sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. What the Roman enjoys in the arena, the Christian in the ecstasies of the cross, the Spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake, or of the bull-fight, the present-day Japanese who presses his way to the tragedy, the workman of the Parisian suburbs who has a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
196 of 301 
homesickness for bloody revolutions, the Wagnerienne who, with unhinged will, undergoes the performance of Tristan and Isoldewhat all these enjoy, and strive with mysterious ardour to drink in, is the philtre of the great Circe cruelty. Here, to be sure, we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of former times, which could only teach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the suffering of OTHERS: there is an abundant, super-abundant enjoyment even in ones own suffering, in causing ones own sufferingand wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded to self-denial in the RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation, as among the Phoenicians and ascetics, or in general, to desensualisation, decarnalisation, and contrition, to Puritanical repentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience and to Pascal- like SACRIFIZIA DELL INTELLETO, he is secretly allured and impelled forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of cruelty TOWARDS HIMSELF.Finally, let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty, in that he compels his spirit to perceive AGAINST its own inclination, and often enough against the wishes of his heart:he forces it to say Nay, where he would like to affirm, love, and adore; indeed, every instance of taking a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
197 of 301 
thing profoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an intentional injuring of the fundamental will of the spirit, which instinctively aims at appearance and superficiality, even in every desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty. 230. Perhaps what I have said here about a fundamental will of the spirit may not be understood without further details; I may be allowed a word of explanation.That imperious something which is popularly called the spirit, wishes to be master internally and externally, and to feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a simplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will. Its requirements and capacities here, are the same as those assigned by physiologists to everything that lives, grows, and multiplies. The power of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong tendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold, to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it arbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself certain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of the outside world. Its object thereby is the incorporation of new experiences, the assortment of new things in the old arrangementsin short, growth; or more properly, the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
198 of 301 
FEELING of growth, the feeling of increased poweris its object. This same will has at its service an apparently opposed impulse of the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance, of arbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner denial of this or that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive attitude against much that is knowable, a contentment with obscurity, with the shutting-in horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance: as that which is all necessary according to the degree of its appropriating power, its digestive power, to speak figuratively (and in fact the spirit resembles a stomach more than anything else). Here also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived (perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so, but is only allowed to pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity, an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness and mystery, of the too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified, the diminished, the misshapen, the beautifiedan enjoyment of the arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. Finally, in this connection, there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to deceive other spirits and dissemble before them the constant pressing and straining of a creating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit enjoys 
Beyond Good and Evil  
199 of 301 
therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys also its feeling of security thereinit is precisely by its Protean arts that it is best protected and concealed! COUNTER TO this propensity for appearance, for simplification, for a disguise, for a cloak, in short, for an outsidefor every outside is a cloakthere operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge, which takes, and INSISTS on taking things profoundly, variously, and thoroughly; as a kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste, which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself, provided, as it ought to be, that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for introspection, and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe words. He will say: There is something cruel in the tendency of my spirit": let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not so! In fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty, perhaps our extravagant honesty were talked about, whispered about, and glorifiedwe free, VERY free spiritsand some day perhaps SUCH will actually be ourposthumous glory! Meanwhile for there is plenty of time until thenwe should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in such florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work has just made us sick of this taste and its sprightly 
Beyond Good and Evil  
200 of 301 
exuberance. They are beautiful, glistening, jingling, festive words: honesty, love of truth, love of wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, heroism of the truthful there is something in them that makes ones heart swell with pride. But we anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorites conscience, that this worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment, frippery, and gold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and that even under such flattering colour and repainting, the terrible original text HOMO NATURA must again be recognized. In effect, to translate man back again into nature; to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal original text, HOMO NATURA; to bring it about that man shall henceforth stand before man as he now, hardened by the discipline of science, stands before the OTHER forms of nature, with fearless Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the enticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to him far too long: Thou art more! thou art higher! thou hast a different origin!this may be a strange and foolish task, but that it is a TASK, who can deny! Why did we choose it, this foolish task? Or, to put the question differently: 
Beyond Good and Evil  
201 of 301 
Why knowledge at all? Every one will ask us about this. And thus pressed, we, who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times, have not found and cannot find any better answer. 231. Learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that does not merely conserveas the physiologist knows. But at the bottom of our souls, quite down below, there is certainly something unteachable, a granite of spiritual fate, of predetermined decision and answer to predetermined, chosen questions. In each cardinal problem there speaks an unchangeable I am this"; a thinker cannot learn anew about man and woman, for instance, but can only learn fullyhe can only follow to the end what is fixed about them in himself. Occasionally we find certain solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us; perhaps they are henceforth called convictions. Later onone sees in them only footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the problem which we ourselves AREor more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody, our spiritual fate, the UNTEACHABLE in us, quite down below.In view of this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself, permission will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about woman as 
Beyond Good and Evil  
202 of 301 
she is, provided that it is known at the outset how literally they are merelyMY truths. 232. Woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she begins to enlighten men about woman as she is THIS is one of the worst developments of the general UGLIFYING of Europe. For what must these clumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self- exposure bring to light! Woman has so much cause for shame; in woman there is so much pedantry, superficiality, schoolmasterliness, petty presumption, unbridledness, and indiscretion concealedstudy only womans behaviour towards children!which has really been best restrained and dominated hitherto by the FEAR of man. Alas, if ever the eternally tedious in womanshe has plenty of it!is allowed to venture forth! if she begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art-of charming, of playing, of frightening away sorrow, of alleviating and taking easily; if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable desires! Female voices are already raised, which, by Saint Aristophanes! make one afraid:with medical explicitness it is stated in a threatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from man. Is it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be scientific? Enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been 
Beyond Good and Evil  
203 of 301 
mens affair, mens gift-we remained therewith among ourselves"; and in the end, in view of all that women write about woman, we may well have considerable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment about herselfand CAN desire it. If woman does not thereby seek a new ORNAMENT for herselfI believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally feminine?why, then, she wishes to make herself feared: perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery. But she does not want truthwhat does woman care for truth? From the very first, nothing is more foreign, more repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truthher great art is falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess it, we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman: we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the company of beings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our seriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to us. Finally, I ask the question: Did a woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in a womans mind, or justice in a womans heart? And is it not true that on the whole woman has hitherto been most despised by woman herself, and not at all by us? We men desire that woman should not continue to 
Beyond Good and Evil  
204 of 301 
compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it was mans care and the consideration for woman, when the church decreed: mulier taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of woman when Napoleon gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand: mulier taceat in politicis!and in my opinion, he is a true friend of woman who calls out to women today: mulier taceat de mulierel. 233. It betrays corruption of the instinctsapart from the fact that it betrays bad tastewhen a woman refers to Madame Roland, or Madame de Stael, or Monsieur George Sand, as though something were proved thereby in favour of woman as she is. Among men, these are the three comical women as they arenothing more!and just the best involuntary counter-arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy. 234. Stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terrible thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of the house is managed! Woman does not understand what food means, and she insists on being cook! If woman had been a thinking creature, she should certainly, as cook for thousands of years, have discovered the most important physiological facts, and should likewise have got possession of the healing art! Through bad female cooksthrough the entire lack of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
205 of 301 
reason in the kitchenthe development of mankind has been longest retarded and most interfered with: even today matters are very little better. A word to High School girls. 235. There are turns and casts of fancy, there are sentences, little handfuls of words, in which a whole culture, a whole society suddenly crystallises itself. Among these is the incidental remark of Madame de Lambert to her son: MON AMI, NE VOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DES FOLIES, QUI VOUS FERONT GRAND PLAISIRthe motherliest and wisest remark, by the way, that was ever addressed to a son. 236. I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what Dante and Goethe believed about woman the former when he sang, ELLA GUARDAVA SUSO, ED IO IN LEI, and the latter when he interpreted it, the eternally feminine draws us ALOFT"; for THIS is just what she believes of the eternally masculine. 237. SEVEN APOPHTHEGMS FOR WOMEN How the longest ennui flees, When a man comes to our knees! Age, alas! and science staid, Furnish even weak virtue aid. 
Beyond Good and Evil  
206 of 301 
Sombre garb and silence meet: Dress for every dame discreet. Whom I thank when in my bliss? God!and my good tailoress! Young, a flower-decked cavern home; Old, a dragon thence doth roam. Noble title, leg thats fine, Man as well: Oh, were HE mine! Speech in brief and sense in massSlippery for the jenny-ass! 237A. Woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds, which, losing their way, have come down among them from an elevation: as something delicate, fragile, wild, strange, sweet, and animatingbut as something also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away. 238. To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of man and woman, to deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally hostile tension, to dream here perhaps of equal rights, equal training, equal claims and obligations: that is a TYPICAL sign of shallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved himself shallow at this dangerous spotshallow in instinct!may generally be regarded as suspicious, nay more, as betrayed, as discovered; he will probably prove 
Beyond Good and Evil  
207 of 301 
too short for all fundamental questions of life, future as well as present, and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On the other hand, a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires, and has also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and harshness, and easily confounded with them, can only think of woman as ORIENTALS do: he must conceive of her as a possession, as confinable property, as a being predestined for service and accomplishing her mission thereinhe must take his stand in this matter upon the immense rationality of Asia, upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia, as the Greeks did formerly; those best heirs and scholars of Asiawho, as is well known, with their INCREASING culture and amplitude of power, from Homer to the time of Pericles, became gradually STRICTER towards woman, in short, more Oriental. HOW necessary, HOW logical, even HOW humanely desirable this was, let us consider for ourselves! 239. The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so much respect by men as at presentthis belongs to the tendency and fundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as disrespectfulness to old agewhat wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of this respect? They want more, they learn to make 
Beyond Good and Evil  
208 of 301 
claims, the tribute of respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights, indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is losing modesty. And let us immediately add that she is also losing taste. She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who unlearns to fear sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture forward when the fear-inspiring quality in manor more definitely, the MAN in manis no longer either desired or fully developed, is reasonable enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficult to understand is that precisely thereby woman deteriorates. This is what is happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it! Wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit, woman strives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk: woman as clerkess is inscribed on the portal of the modern society which is in course of formation. While she thus appropriates new rights, aspires to be master, and inscribes progress of woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite realises itself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES. Since the French Revolution the influence of woman in Europe has DECLINED in proportion as she has increased her rights and claims; and the emancipation of woman, insofar as it 
Beyond Good and Evil  
209 of 301 
is desired and demanded by women themselves (and not only by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instincts. There is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost masculine stupidity, of which a well-reared womanwho is always a sensible womanmight be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as to the ground upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise in the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man, perhaps even to the book, where formerly she kept herself in control and in refined, artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity mans faith in a VEILED, fundamentally different ideal in woman, something eternally, necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved, cared for, protected, and indulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and often pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of woman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still entails (as though slavery were a counter- argument, and not rather a condition of every higher culture, of every elevation of culture):what does all this 
Beyond Good and Evil  
210 of 301 
betoken, if not a disintegration of womanly instincts, a defeminising? Certainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and corrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex, who advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate all the stupidities from which man in Europe, European manliness, suffers,who would like to lower woman to general culture, indeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. Here and there they wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers: as though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and godless man;almost everywhere her nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music (our latest German music), and she is daily being made more hysterical and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of bearing robust children. They wish to cultivate her in general still more, and intend, as they say, to make the weaker sex STRONG by culture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that the cultivating of mankind and his weakeningthat is to say, the weakening, dissipating, and languishing of his FORCE OF WILLhave always kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and influential women in the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
211 of 301 
world (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon) had just to thank their force of willand not their schoolmastersfor their power and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respect in woman, and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more natural than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning flexibility, her tigerclaws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in egoism, her untrainableness and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness, extent, and deviation of her desires and virtues. That which, in spite of fear, excites ones sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat, woman, is that she seems more afflicted, more vulnerable, more necessitous of love, and more condemned to disillusionment than any other creature. Fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot already in tragedy, which rends while it delightsWhat? And all that is now to be at an end? And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress? The tediousness of woman is slowly evolving? Oh Europe! Europe! We know the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee, from which danger is ever again threatening thee! Thy old fable might once more become historyan immense stupidity might once again

CHAPTER VIII: PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES 
240. I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagners overture to the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy, latter-day art, which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music as still living, in order that it may be understood:it is an honour to Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate! What flavours and forces, what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! It impresses us at one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter, and too modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it is not infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarseit has fire and courage, and at the same time the loose, dun- coloured skin of fruits which ripen too late. It flows broad and full: and suddenly there is a moment of inexplicable hesitation, like a gap that opens between cause and effect, an oppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but already it broadens and widens anew, the old stream of delight-the most manifold delight,of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY the joy of the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his astonished, happy 
Beyond Good and Evil  
214 of 301 
cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here employed, the new, newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art which he apparently betrays to us. All in all, however, no beauty, no South, nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing of grace, no dance, hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even, which is also emphasized, as though the artist wished to say to us: It is part of my intention"; a cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily barbaric and ceremonious, a flirring of learned and venerable conceits and witticisms; something German in the best and worst sense of the word, something in the German style, manifold, formless, and inexhaustible; a certain German potency and superplenitude of soul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS of decadencewhich, perhaps, feels itself most at ease there; a real, genuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time young and aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. This kind of music expresses best what I think of the Germans: they belong to the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow THEY HAVE AS YET NO TODAY. 241. We good Europeans, we also have hours when we allow ourselves a warm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow viewsI have just 
Beyond Good and Evil  
215 of 301 
given an example of it hours of national excitement, of patriotic anguish, and all other sorts of old-fashioned floods of sentiment. Duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confines its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hoursin a considerable time: some in half a year, others in half a lifetime, according to the speed and strength with which they digest and change their material. Indeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races, which even in our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century ere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and soil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say, to good Europeanism. And while digressing on this possibility, I happen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two old patriotsthey were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently spoke all the louder. HE has as much, and knows as much, philosophy as a peasant or a corps-student, said the one he is still innocent. But what does that matter nowadays! It is the age of the masses: they lie on their belly before everything that is massive. And so also in politicis. A statesman who rears up for them a new Tower of Babel, some monstrosity of empire and power, they call greatwhat does it matter that we more prudent and conservative ones do not 
Beyond Good and Evil  
216 of 301 
meanwhile give up the old belief that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or affair. Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position of being obliged henceforth to practise high politics, for which they were by nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have to sacrifice their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and doubtful mediocrity; supposing a statesman were to condemn his people generally to practise politics, when they have hitherto had something better to do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of the restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the essentially politicspractising nations;supposing such a statesman were to stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people, were to make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness, an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to depreciate their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences, make their minds narrow, and their tastes national what! a statesman who should do all this, which his people would have to do penance for throughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a statesman would be GREAT, would he?Undoubtedly! replied the other 
Beyond Good and Evil  
217 of 301 
old patriot vehemently, otherwise he COULD NOT have done it! It was mad perhaps to wish such a thing! But perhaps everything great has been just as mad at its commencement! Misuse of words! cried his interlocutor, contradictorily strong! strong! Strong and mad! NOT great!The old men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their truths in each others faces, but I, in my happiness and apartness, considered how soon a stronger one may become master of the strong, and also that there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a nationnamely, in the deepening of another. 242. Whether we call it civilization, or humanising, or progress, which now distinguishes the European, whether we call it simply, without praise or blame, by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in Europebehind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by such formulas, an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS goes on, which is ever extending the process of the assimilation of Europeans, their increasing detachment from the conditions under which, climatically and hereditarily, united races originate, their increasing independence of every definite milieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself with equal 
Beyond Good and Evil  
218 of 301 
demands on soul and body,that is to say, the slow emergence of an essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man, who possesses, physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and power of adaptation as his typical distinction. This process of the EVOLVING EUROPEAN, which can be retarded in its TEMPO by great relapses, but will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depththe still-raging storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to it, and also the anarchism which is appearing at presentthis process will probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and panegyrists, the apostles of modern ideas, would least care to reckon. The same new conditions under which on an average a levelling and mediocrising of man will take placea useful, industrious, variously serviceable, and clever gregarious manare in the highest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and attractive qualities. For, while the capacity for adaptation, which is every day trying changing conditions, and begins a new work with every generation, almost with every decade, makes the POWERFULNESS of the type impossible; while the collective impression of such future Europeans will probably be that of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very handy workmen who REQUIRE a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
219 of 301 
master, a commander, as they require their daily bread; while, therefore, the democratising of Europe will tend to the production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle sense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in individual and exceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever been beforeowing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling, owing to the immense variety of practice, art, and disguise. I meant to say that the democratising of Europe is at the same time an involuntary arrangement for the rearing of TYRANTStaking the word in all its meanings, even in its most spiritual sense. 243. I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the constellation Hercules: and I hope that the men on this earth will do like the sun. And we foremost, we good Europeans! 244. There was a time when it was customary to call Germans deep by way of distinction; but now that the most successful type of new Germanism is covetous of quite other honours, and perhaps misses smartness in all that has depth, it is almost opportune and patriotic to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that commendation: in short, whether German depth is not at bottom something different and worseand 
Beyond Good and Evil  
220 of 301 
something from which, thank God, we are on the point of successfully ridding ourselves. Let us try, then, to relearn with regard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose is a little vivisection of the German soul. The German soul is above all manifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super- imposed, rather than actually built: this is owing to its origin. A German who would embolden himself to assert: Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast, would make a bad guess at the truth, or, more correctly, he would come far short of the truth about the number of souls. As a people made up of the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a preponderance of the pre-Aryan element as the people of the centre in every sense of the term, the Germans are more intangible, more ample, more contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more surprising, and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves:they escape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the despair of the French. It IS characteristic of the Germans that the question: What is German? never dies out among them. Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well enough: We are known, they cried jubilantly to himbut Sand also thought he knew them. Jean Paul knew what he was doing when he declared 
Beyond Good and Evil  
221 of 301 
himself incensed at Fichtes lying but patriotic flatteries and exaggerations,but it is probable that Goethe thought differently about Germans from Jean Paul, even though he acknowledged him to be right with regard to Fichte. It is a question what Goethe really thought about the Germans?But about many things around him he never spoke explicitly, and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silenceprobably he had good reason for it. It is certain that it was not the Wars of Independence that made him look up more joyfully, any more than it was the French Revolution,the event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTED his Faust, and indeed the whole problem of man, was the appearance of Napoleon. There are words of Goethe in which he condemns with impatient severity, as from a foreign land, that which Germans take a pride in, he once defined the famous German turn of mind as Indulgence towards its own and others weaknesses. Was he wrong? it is characteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them. The German soul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves, hiding- places, and dungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious, the German is well acquainted with the bypaths to chaos. And as everything loves its symbol, so the German loves the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
222 of 301 
clouds and all that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp, and shrouded, it seems to him that everything uncertain, undeveloped, self-displacing, and growing is deep". The German himself does not EXIST, he is BECOMING, he is developing himself". Development is therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the great domain of philosophical formulas, a ruling idea, which, together with German beer and German music, is labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreigners are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature at the basis of the German soul propounds to them (riddles which Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to music). Good-natured and spitefulsuch a juxtaposition, preposterous in the case of every other people, is unfortunately only too often justified in Germany one has only to live for a while among Swabians to know this! The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and nimble boldness, of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid. If any one wishes to see the German soul demonstrated ad oculos, let him only look at German taste, at German arts and manners what boorish indifference to taste! How the noblest and the commonest stand there in juxtaposition! How disorderly 
Beyond Good and Evil  
223 of 301 
and how rich is the whole constitution of this soul! The German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he experiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets done with them; and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating digestion. And just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like what is convenient, so the German loves frankness and honesty"; it is so CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!This confidingness, this complaisance, this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is probably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to nowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can still achieve much! The German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with faithful, blue, empty German eyesand other countries immediately confound him with his dressing-gown!I meant to say that, let German depth be what it willamong ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at itwe shall do well to continue henceforth to honour its appearance and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our old reputation as a people of depth for Prussian smartness, and Berlin wit and sand. It is wise for a people to pose, and LET itself be regarded, as profound, clumsy, good-natured, honest, and foolish: it might even beprofound to do so! Finally, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
224 of 301 
we should do honour to our namewe are not called the TIUSCHE VOLK (deceptive people) for nothing. 245. The good old time is past, it sang itself out in Mozart how happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to us, that his good company, his tender enthusiasm, his childish delight in the Chinese and its flourishes, his courtesy of heart, his longing for the elegant, the amorous, the tripping, the tearful, and his belief in the South, can still appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in us! Ah, some time or other it will be over with it!but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with the intelligence and taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echo of a break and transition in style, and NOT, like Mozart, the last echo of a great European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethoven is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking down, and a future over-young soul that is always COMING; there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal extravagant hope, the same light in which Europe was bathed when it dreamed with Rousseau, when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the Revolution, and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon. But how rapidly does THIS very sentiment now pale, how difficult nowadays is 
Beyond Good and Evil  
225 of 301 
even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment, how strangely does the language of Rousseau, Schiller, Shelley, and Byron sound to our ear, in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe was able to SPEAK, which knew how to SING in Beethoven!Whatever German music came afterwards, belongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to a movement which, historically considered, was still shorter, more fleeting, and more superficial than that great interlude, the transition of Europe from Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the rise of democracy. Weberbut what do WE care nowadays for Freischutz and Oberon! Or Marschners Hans Heiling and Vampyre! Or even Wagners Tannhauser! That is extinct, although not yet forgotten music. This whole music of Romanticism, besides, was not noble enough, was not musical enough, to maintain its position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses; from the beginning it was second-rate music, which was little thought of by genuine musicians. It was different with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon master, who, on account of his lighter, purer, happier soul, quickly acquired admiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautiful EPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann, who took things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the firsthe 
Beyond Good and Evil  
226 of 301 
was the last that founded a school,do we not now regard it as a satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very Romanticism of Schumanns has been surmounted? Schumann, fleeing into the Saxon Switzerland of his soul, with a half Werther-like, half Jean-Paul-like nature (assuredly not like Beethoven! assuredly not like Byron!) his MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of injustice; Schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY taste (that is to say, a dangerous propensitydoubly dangerous among Germansfor quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings), going constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble weakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the beginning a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGEREthis Schumann was already merely a GERMAN event in music, and no longer a European event, as Beethoven had been, as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German music was threatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair. 246. What a torture are books written in German to a reader who has a THIRD ear! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp of sounds without tune 
Beyond Good and Evil  
227 of 301 
and rhythms without dance, which Germans call a book! And even the German who READS books! How lazily, how reluctantly, how badly he reads! How many Germans know, and consider it obligatory to know, that there is ART in every good sentenceart which must be divined, if the sentence is to be understood! If there is a misunderstanding about its TEMPO, for instance, the sentence itself is misunderstood! That one must not be doubtful about the rhythm-determining syllables, that one should feel the breaking of the too-rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm, that one should lend a fine and patient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO, that one should divine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs, and how delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of their arrangementwho among book-reading Germans is complaisant enough to recognize such duties and requirements, and to listen to so much art and intention in language? After all, one just has no ear for it"; and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard, and the most delicate artistry is as it were SQUANDERED on the deaf.These were my thoughts when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in the art of prose- writing have been confounded: one, whose words drop 
Beyond Good and Evil  
228 of 301 
down hesitatingly and coldly, as from the roof of a damp cavehe counts on their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates his language like a flexible sword, and from his arm down into his toes feels the dangerous bliss of the quivering, over-sharp blade, which wishes to bite, hiss, and cut. 247. How little the German style has to do with harmony and with the ear, is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves write badly. The German does not read aloud, he does not read for the ear, but only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer for the time. In antiquity when a man read which was seldom enoughhe read something to himself, and in a loud voice; they were surprised when any one read silently, and sought secretly the reason of it. In a loud voice: that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, and variations of key and changes of TEMPO, in which the ancient PUBLIC world took delight. The laws of the written style were then the same as those of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the surprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx; partly on the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lungs. In the ancient sense, a period is above all a physiological whole, inasmuch as it is comprised in 
Beyond Good and Evil  
229 of 301 
one breath. Such periods as occur in Demosthenes and Cicero, swelling twice and sinking twice, and all in one breath, were pleasures to the men of ANTIQUITY, who knew by their own schooling how to appreciate the virtue therein, the rareness and the difficulty in the deliverance of such a period;WE have really no right to the BIG period, we modern men, who are short of breath in every sense! Those ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti in speaking, consequently connoisseurs, consequently criticsthey thus brought their orators to the highest pitch; in the same manner as in the last century, when all Italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song (and with it also the art of melody) reached its elevation. In Germany, however (until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings), there was properly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artistical discoursethat delivered from the pulpit. The preacher was the only one in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a sentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone had a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for reasons are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom 
Beyond Good and Evil  
230 of 301 
attained by a German, or almost always too late. The masterpiece of German prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its greatest preacher: the BIBLE has hitherto been the best German book. Compared with Luthers Bible, almost everything else is merely literaturesomething which has not grown in Germany, and therefore has not taken and does not take root in German hearts, as the Bible has done. 248. There are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all engenders and seeks to engender, and another which willingly lets itself be fructified and brings forth. And similarly, among the gifted nations, there are those on whom the womans problem of pregnancy has devolved, and the secret task of forming, maturing, and perfecting the Greeks, for instance, were a nation of this kind, and so are the French; and others which have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of lifelike the Jews, the Romans, and, in all modesty be it asked: like the Germans? nations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and irresistibly forced out of themselves, amorous and longing for foreign races (for such as let themselves be fructified), and withal imperious, like everything conscious of being full of generative force, and consequently empowered by the grace of God. These 
Beyond Good and Evil  
231 of 301 
two kinds of geniuses seek each other like man and woman; but they also misunderstand each otherlike man and woman. 249. Every nation has its own Tartuffery, and calls that its virtue.One does not knowcannot know, the best that is in one. 250. What Europe owes to the Jews?Many things, good and bad, and above all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst: the grand style in morality, the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands, of infinite significations, the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moral questionablenessand consequently just the most attractive, ensnaring, and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to life, in the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture, its evening sky, now glowsperhaps glows out. For this, we artists among the spectators and philosophers, aregrateful to the Jews. 251. It must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and disturbancesin short, slight attacks of stupiditypass over the spirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from national nervous fever and political ambition: for instance, among present-day Germans there is alternately the anti-French folly, the anti-Semitic folly, the anti-Polish folly, the Christian-romantic folly, the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
232 of 301 
Wagnerian folly, the Teutonic folly, the Prussian folly (just look at those poor historians, the Sybels and Treitschkes, and their closely bandaged heads), and whatever else these little obscurations of the German spirit and conscience may be called. May it be forgiven me that I, too, when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground, did not remain wholly exempt from the disease, but like every one else, began to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern methe first symptom of political infection. About the Jews, for instance, listen to the following:I have never yet met a German who was favourably inclined to the Jews; and however decided the repudiation of actual anti-Semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men, this prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself, but only against its dangerous excess, and especially against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of sentiment; on this point we must not deceive ourselves. That Germany has amply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach, the German blood, has difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing only of this quantity of Jewas the Italian, the Frenchman, and the Englishman have done by means of a stronger digestion: that is the unmistakable declaration and language of a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
233 of 301 
general instinct, to which one must listen and according to which one must act. Let no more Jews come in! And shut the doors, especially towards the East (also towards Austria)!thus commands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and uncertain, so that it could be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by a stronger race. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest, toughest, and purest race at present living in Europe, they know how to succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better than under favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one would like nowadays to label as vicesowing above all to a resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before modern ideas, they alter only, WHEN they do alter, in the same way that the Russian Empire makes its conquestas an empire that has plenty of time and is not of yesterdaynamely, according to the principle, as slowly as possible! A thinker who has the future of Europe at heart, will, in all his perspectives concerning the future, calculate upon the Jews, as he will calculate upon the Russians, as above all the surest and likeliest factors in the great play and battle of forces. That which is at present called a nation in Europe, and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA (indeed, sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA), is in 
Beyond Good and Evil  
234 of 301 
every case something evolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet a race, much less such a race AERE PERENNUS, as the Jews are such nations should most carefully avoid all hotheaded rivalry and hostility! It is certain that the Jews, if they desiredor if they were driven to it, as the anti-Semites seem to wishCOULD now have the ascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they are NOT working and planning for that end is equally certain. Meanwhile, they rather wish and desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and absorbed by Europe, they long to be finally settled, authorized, and respected somewhere, and wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the wandering Jew, and one should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency, and MAKE ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation of the Jewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful and fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country. One should make advances with all prudence, and with selection, pretty much as the English nobility do It stands to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked types of new Germanism could enter into relation with the Jews with the least hesitation, for instance, the nobleman officer from the Prussian border it would be interesting in many ways 
Beyond Good and Evil  
235 of 301 
to see whether the genius for money and patience (and especially some intellect and intellectualitysadly lacking in the place referred to) could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of commanding and obeyingfor both of which the country in question has now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break off my festal discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have already reached my SERIOUS TOPIC, the European problem, as I understand it, the rearing of a new ruling caste for Europe. 252. They are not a philosophical racethe English: Bacon represents an ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally, Hobbes, Hume, and Locke, an abasement, and a depreciation of the idea of a philosopher for more than a century. It was AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself; it was Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said, JE MEPRISE LOCKE"; in the struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world, Hegel and Schopenhauer (along with Goethe) were of one accord; the two hostile brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different directions towards the opposite poles of German thought, and thereby wronged each other as only brothers will do.What is lacking in England, and has always been lacking, that half-actor and 
Beyond Good and Evil  
236 of 301 
rhetorician knew well enough, the absurd muddle-head, Carlyle, who sought to conceal under passionate grimaces what he knew about himself: namely, what was LACKING in Carlylereal POWER of intellect, real DEPTH of intellectual perception, in short, philosophy. It is characteristic of such an unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianitythey NEED its discipline for moralizing and humanizing. The Englishman, more gloomy, sensual, headstrong, and brutal than the Germanis for that very reason, as the baser of the two, also the most pious: he has all the MORE NEED of Christianity. To finer nostrils, this English Christianity itself has still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic excess, for which, owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidotethe finer poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning is in fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people, a step towards spiritualization. The English coarseness and rustic demureness is still most satisfactorily disguised by Christian pantomime, and by praying and psalm-singing (or, more correctly, it is thereby explained and differently expressed); and for the herd of drunkards and rakes who formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism (and more recently as the Salvation Army), a penitential 
Beyond Good and Evil  
237 of 301 
fit may really be the relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they can be elevated: so much may reasonably be admitted. That, however, which offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music, to speak figuratively (and also literally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul and body; indeed, not even the desire for rhythm and dance, for music. Listen to him speaking; look at the most beautiful Englishwoman WALKINGin no country on earth are there more beautiful doves and swans; finally, listen to them singing! But I ask too much  253. There are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds, because they are best adapted for them, there are truths which only possess charms and seductive power for mediocre spirits:one is pushed to this probably unpleasant conclusion, now that the influence of respectable but mediocre EnglishmenI may mention Darwin, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencerbegins to gain the ascendancy in the middle-class region of European taste. Indeed, who could doubt that it is a useful thing for SUCH minds to have the ascendancy for a time? It would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently soaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting many little common facts, and 
Beyond Good and Evil

deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions, they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards those who are the rules. After all, they have more to do than merely to perceive:in effect, they have to BE something new, they have to SIGNIFY something new, they have to REPRESENT new values! The gulf between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater, and also more mysterious, than one thinks: the capable man in the grand style, the creator, will possibly have to be an ignorant person;while on the other hand, for scientific discoveries like those of Darwin, a certain narrowness, aridity, and industrious carefulness (in short, something English) may not be unfavourable for arriving at them. Finally, let it not be forgotten that the English, with their profound mediocrity, brought about once before a general depression of European intelligence. What is called modern ideas, or the ideas of the eighteenth century, or French ideasthat, consequently, against which the GERMAN mind rose up with profound disgustis of English origin, there is no doubt about it. The French were only the apes and actors of these ideas, their best soldiers, and likewise, alas! their first and profoundest VICTIMS; for owing to the diabolical Anglomania of modern ideas, the AME FRANCAIS has 
Beyond Good and Evil  
239 of 301 
in the end become so thin and emaciated, that at present one recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its profound, passionate strength, its inventive excellency, almost with disbelief. One must, however, maintain this verdict of historical justice in a determined manner, and defend it against present prejudices and appearances: the European NOBLESSEof sentiment, taste, and manners, taking the word in every high senseis the work and invention of FRANCE; the European ignobleness, the plebeianism of modern ideasis ENGLANDS work and invention. 254. Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectual and refined culture of Europe, it is still the high school of taste; but one must know how to find this France of taste. He who belongs to it keeps himself well concealed:they may be a small number in whom it lives and is embodied, besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon the strongest legs, in part fatalists, hypochondriacs, invalids, in part persons over- indulged, over-refined, such as have the AMBITION to conceal themselves. They have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic BOURGEOIS. In fact, a 
Beyond Good and Evil  
240 of 301 
besotted and brutalized France at present sprawls in the foregroundit recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste, and at the same time of self- admiration, at the funeral of Victor Hugo. There is also something else common to them: a predilection to resist intellectual Germanizingand a still greater inability to do so! In this France of intellect, which is also a France of pessimism, Schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more indigenous than he has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine, who has long ago been reincarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists of Paris; or of Hegel, who at present, in the form of Taine the FIRST of living historiansexercises an almost tyrannical influence. As regards Richard Wagner, however, the more French music learns to adapt itself to the actual needs of the AME MODERNE, the more will it Wagnerite"; one can safely predict that beforehand,it is already taking place sufficiently! There are, however, three things which the French can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession, and as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority in Europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and vulgarizing of taste. FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic emotion, for devotion to form, for which the expression, LART 
Beyond Good and Evil  
241 of 301 
POUR LART, along with numerous others, has been invented:such capacity has not been lacking in France for three centuries; and owing to its reverence for the small number, it has again and again made a sort of chamber music of literature possible, which is sought for in vain elsewhere in Europe.The SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim to a superiority over Europe is their ancient, many-sided, MORALISTIC culture, owing to which one finds on an average, even in the petty ROMANCIERS of the newspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS, a psychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one has no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany. The Germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite thereto, which, as we have said, France has not grudged: those who call the Germans naive on that account give them commendation for a defect. (As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE PSYCHOLOGICA, which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness of German intercourse,and as the most successful expression of genuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate thrills, Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory and forerunning 
Beyond Good and Evil  
242 of 301 
man, who, with a Napoleonic TEMPO, traversed HIS Europe, in fact, several centuries of the European soul, as a surveyor and discoverer thereof:it has required two generations to OVERTAKE him one way or other, to divine long afterwards some of the riddles that perplexed and enraptured himthis strange Epicurean and man of interrogation, the last great psychologist of France). There is yet a THIRD claim to superiority: in the French character there is a successful half-way synthesis of the North and South, which makes them comprehend many things, and enjoins upon them other things, which an Englishman can never comprehend. Their temperament, turned alternately to and from the South, in which from time to time the Provencal and Ligurian blood froths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern grey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty of bloodour GERMAN infirmity of taste, for the excessive prevalence of which at the present moment, blood and iron, that is to say high politics, has with great resolution been prescribed (according to a dangerous healing art, which bids me wait and wait, but not yet hope).There is also still in France a pre-understanding and ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men, who are too comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
243 of 301 
fatherlandism, and know how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the Souththe born Midlanders, the good Europeans. For them BIZET has made music, this latest genius, who has seen a new beauty and seduction,who has discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC. 255. I hold that many precautions should be taken against German music. Suppose a person loves the South as I love itas a great school of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills, as a boundless solar profusion and effulgence which oerspreads a sovereign existence believing in itselfwell, such a person will learn to be somewhat on his guard against German music, because, in injuring his taste anew, it will also injure his health anew. Such a Southerner, a Southerner not by origin but by BELIEF, if he should dream of the future of music, must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the North; and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and perhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-German music, which does not fade, pale, and die away, as all German music does, at the sight of the blue, wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of skya super-European music, which holds its own even in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
244 of 301 
whose soul is akin to the palm-tree, and can be at home and can roam with big, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey  I could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of good and evil; only that here and there perhaps some sailors home-sickness, some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might sweep lightly over it; an art which, from the far distance, would see the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing towards it, and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to receive such belated fugitives. 256. Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze has induced and still induces among the nations of Europe, owing also to the short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with the help of this craze, are at present in power, and do not suspect to what extent the disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude policyowing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable at present, the most unmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE, are now overlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted. With all the more profound and largeminded men of this century, the real general tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way 
Beyond Good and Evil  
245 of 301 
for that new SYNTHESIS, and tentatively to anticipate the European of the future; only in their simulations, or in their weaker moments, in old age perhaps, did they belong to the fatherlandsthey only rested from themselves when they became patriots. I think of such men as Napoleon, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: it must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them, about whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings (geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves), still less, of course, by the unseemly noise with which he is now resisted and opposed in France: the fact remains, nevertheless, that Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forties, are most closely and intimately related to one another. They are akin, fundamentally akin, in all the heights and depths of their requirements; it is Europe, the ONE Europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly, outwards and upwards, in their multifarious and boisterous art whither? into a new light? towards a new sun? But who would attempt to express accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not express distinctly? It is certain that the same storm and stress tormented them, that they SOUGHT in the same manner, these last great 
Beyond Good and Evil  
246 of 301 
seekers! All of them steeped in literature to their eyes and earsthe first artists of universal literary culturefor the most part even themselves writers, poets, intermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses (Wagner, as musician is reckoned among painters, as poet among musicians, as artist generally among actors); all of them fanatics for EXPRESSION at any costI specially mention Delacroix, the nearest related to Wagner; all of them great discoverers in the realm of the sublime, also of the loathsome and dreadful, still greater discoverers in effect, in display, in the art of the show-shop; all of them talented far beyond their genius, out and out VIRTUOSI, with mysterious accesses to all that seduces, allures, constrains, and upsets; born enemies of logic and of the straight line, hankering after the strange, the exotic, the monstrous, the crooked, and the self-contradictory; as men, Tantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus, who knew themselves to be incapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life and action think of Balzac, for instance,unrestrained workers, almost destroying themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners, ambitious and insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all of them finally shattering and sinking down at the Christian cross (and with right and reason, for who 
Beyond Good and Evil  
247 of 301 
of them would have been sufficiently profound and sufficiently original for an ANTI- CHRISTIAN philosophy?);on the whole, a boldly daring, splendidly overbearing, high-flying, and aloft-up-dragging class of higher men, who had first to teach their century-and it is the century of the MASSESthe conception higher man.  Let the German friends of Richard Wagner advise together as to whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art, or whether its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from SUPER- GERMAN sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be underrated how indispensable Paris was to the development of his type, which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most decisive timeand how the whole style of his proceedings, of his self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in sight of the French socialistic original. On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be found, to the honour of Richard Wagners German nature, that he has acted in everything with more strength, daring, severity, and elevation than a nineteenth- century Frenchman could have doneowing to the circumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the French; perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is not only at 
Beyond Good and Evil  
248 of 301 
present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried, that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too cheerful, too healthy, too ANTICATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow civilized nations. He may even have been a sin against Romanticism, this anti-Latin Siegfried: well, Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old sad days, when anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into politicshe began, with the religious vehemence peculiar to him, to preach, at least, THE WAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.That these last words may not be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few powerful rhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what I mean what I mean COUNTER TO the last Wagner and his Parsifal music: Is this our mode?From German heart came this vexed ululating? From German body, this self-lacerating? Is ours this priestly hand-dilation, This incense-fuming exaltation? Is ours this faltering, falling, shambling, This quite uncertain ding-dong- dangling? This sly nun-ogling, Ave-hour-bell ringing, This wholly false enraptured heaven-oerspringing?Is this our mode?Think well!

CHAPTER IX: WHAT IS NOBLE? 
257. EVERY elevation of the type man, has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always bea society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings, and requiring slavery in some form or other. Without the PATHOS OF DISTANCE, such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes, out of the constant outlooking and down-looking of the ruling caste on subordinates and instruments, and out of their equally constant practice of obeying and commanding, of keeping down and keeping at a distancethat other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen, the longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself, the formation of ever higher, rarer, further, more extended, more comprehensive states, in short, just the elevation of the type man, the continued selfsurmounting of man, to use a moral formula in a supermoral sense. To be sure, one must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of an aristocratic society (that is to say, of the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
251 of 301 
preliminary condition for the elevation of the type man): the truth is hard. Let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has ORIGINATED! Men with a still natural nature, barbarians in every terrible sense of the word, men of prey, still in possession of unbroken strength of will and desire for power, threw themselves upon weaker, more moral, more peaceful races (perhaps trading or cattle-rearing communities), or upon old mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering out in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity. At the commencement, the noble caste was always the barbarian caste: their superiority did not consist first of all in their physical, but in their psychical powerthey were more COMPLETE men (which at every point also implies the same as more complete beasts). 258. Corruptionas the indication that anarchy threatens to break out among the instincts, and that the foundation of the emotions, called life, is convulsedis something radically different according to the organization in which it manifests itself. When, for instance, an aristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolution, flung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an excess of its moral sentiments, it was corruption:it was really only the closing act of the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
252 of 301 
corruption which had existed for centuries, by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty (in the end even to its decoration and paradedress). The essential thing, however, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard itself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth, but as the SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereofthat it should therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individuals, who, FOR ITS SAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men, to slaves and instruments. Its fundamental belief must be precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake, but only as a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties, and in general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun- seeking climbing plants in Javathey are called Sipo Matador, which encircle an oak so long and so often with their arms, until at last, high above it, but supported by it, they can unfold their tops in the open light, and exhibit their happiness. 259. To refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from exploitation, and put ones will on a par with that of others: this may result in a certain rough sense in good 
Beyond Good and Evil  
253 of 301 
conduct among individuals when the necessary conditions are given (namely, the actual similarity of the individuals in amount of force and degree of worth, and their corelation within one organization). As soon, however, as one wished to take this principle more generally, and if possible even as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY, it would immediately disclose what it really isnamely, a Will to the DENIAL of life, a principle of dissolution and decay. Here one must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental weakness: life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of peculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest, exploitation;but why should one for ever use precisely these words on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped? Even the organization within which, as was previously supposed, the individuals treat each other as equalit takes place in every healthy aristocracymust itself, if it be a living and not a dying organization, do all that towards other bodies, which the individuals within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the incarnated Will to Power, it will endeavour to grow, to gain ground, attract to itself and acquire ascendancy not owing to any morality or 
Beyond Good and Evil  
254 of 301 
immorality, but because it LIVES, and because life IS precisely Will to Power. On no point, however, is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter, people now rave everywhere, even under the guise of science, about coming conditions of society in which the exploiting character is to be absentthat sounds to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should refrain from all organic functions. Exploitation does not belong to a depraved, or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of the living being as a primary organic function, it is a consequence of the intrinsic Will to Power, which is precisely the Will to LifeGranting that as a theory this is a noveltyas a reality it is the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let us be so far honest towards ourselves! 260. In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I found certain traits recurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until finally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical distinction was brought to light. There is MASTERMORALITY and SLAVE-MORALITY,I would at once add, however, that in all higher and mixed 
Beyond Good and Evil  
255 of 301 
civilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of the two moralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and mutual misunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close juxtapositioneven in the same man, within one soul. The distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruledor among the ruled class, the slaves and dependents of all sorts. In the first case, when it is the rulers who determine the conception good, it is the exalted, proud disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which determines the order of rank. The noble type of man separates from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud disposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be noted that in this first kind of morality the antithesis good and bad means practically the same as noble and despicable,the antithesis good and EVIL is of a different origin. The cowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised; moreover, also, the distrustful, with their constrained glances, the self- abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused, the mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:it is a fundamental belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful. 
Beyond Good and Evil  
256 of 301 
We truthful onesthe nobility in ancient Greece called themselves. It is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to MEN; and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals start with questions like, Why have sympathetic actions been praised? The noble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he does not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: What is injurious to me is injurious in itself; he knows that it is he himself only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES. He honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals selfglorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude, of power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:the noble man also helps the unfortunate, but notor scarcelyout of pity, but rather from an impulse generated by the superabundance of power. The noble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power over himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has reverence for all that is severe and hard. 
Beyond Good and Evil  
257 of 301 
Wotan placed a hard heart in my breast, says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly expressed from the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is even proud of not being made for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly: He who has not a hard heart when young, will never have one. The noble and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality which sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others, or in DESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards selflessness, belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the warm heart.It is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain for invention. The profound reverence for age and for traditionall law rests on this double reverence, the belief and prejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of the powerful; and if, reversely, men of modern ideas believe almost instinctively in progress and the future, and are more and more lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these ideas has complacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of the ruling class, however, is more especially foreign and 
Beyond Good and Evil  
258 of 301 
irritating to present-day taste in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to ones equals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as seems good to one, or as the heart desires, and in any case beyond good and evil": it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a place. The ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revengeboth only within the circle of equals, artfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea in friendship, a certain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogancein fact, in order to be a good FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble morality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of modern ideas, and is therefore at present difficult to realize, and also to unearth and disclose.It is otherwise with the second type of morality, SLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should moralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates? Probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together with his situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for 
Beyond Good and Evil  
259 of 301 
the virtues of the powerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of everything good that is there honouredhe would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and flooded with light; it is here that sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence, humility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the most useful qualities, and almost the only means of supporting the burden of existence. Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility. Here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil":power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do not admit of being despised. According to slave-morality, therefore, the evil man arouses fear; according to mastermorality, it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being. The contrast attains its maximum when, in accordance with the logical consequences of slavemorality, a shade of depreciationit may be slight and well-intentionedat last attaches itself to the good man of this morality; because, according to the servile mode of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
260 of 301 
thought, the good man must in any case be the SAFE man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little stupid, un bonhomme. Everywhere that slave- morality gains the ascendancy, language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words good and stupid.A last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM, the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating. Hence we can understand without further detail why love AS A PASSIONit is our European specialtymust absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its invention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant, ingenious men of the gai saber, to whom Europe owes so much, and almost owes itself. 261. Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for a noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another kind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. The problem for him is to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of themselves which they themselves do not possessand consequently also do not deserve,and who yet 
Beyond Good and Evil  
261 of 301 
BELIEVE in this good opinion afterwards. This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so selfdisrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable, that he would like to consider vanity an exception, and is doubtful about it in most cases when it is spoken of. He will say, for instance: I may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely as I rate it:that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit, or, in most cases, that which is called humility, and also modesty). Or he will even say: For many reasons I can delight in the good opinion of others, perhaps because I love and honour them, and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion, perhaps because the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do not share it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:all this, however, is not vanity. The man of noble character must first bring it home forcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history, that, from time immemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary man WAS only that which he PASSED FOR:not being at all accustomed to fix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value than that 
Beyond Good and Evil  
262 of 301 
which his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to create values). It may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary atavism, that the ordinary man, even at present, is still always WAITING for an opinion about himself, and then instinctively submitting himself to it; yet by no means only to a good opinion, but also to a bad and unjust one (think, for instance, of the greater part of the self- appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn from their confessors, and which in general the believing Christian learns from his Church). In fact, conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order (and its cause, the blending of the blood of masters and slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves, will now be more and more encouraged and extended; but it has at all times an older, ampler, and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to itand in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger. The vain person rejoices over EVERY good opinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point of view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjects himself to both, he feels himself 
Beyond Good and Evil  
263 of 301 
subjected to both, by that oldest instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.It is the slave in the vain mans blood, the remains of the slaves craftinessand how much of the slave is still left in woman, for instance!which seeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions, as though he had not called them forth.And to repeat it again: vanity is an atavism. 262. A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and strong in the long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE conditions. On the other hand, it is known by the experience of breeders that species which receive super-abundant nourishment, and in general a surplus of protection and care, immediately tend in the most marked way to develop variations, and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in monstrous vices). Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say an ancient Greek polis, or Venice, as a voluntary or involuntary contrivance for the purpose of REARING human beings; there are there men beside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who want to make their species prevail, chiefly because they MUST prevail, or else run the terrible danger of being exterminated. The 
Beyond Good and Evil  
264 of 301 
favour, the super-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which variations are fostered; the species needs itself as species, as something which, precisely by virtue of its hardness, its uniformity, and simplicity of structure, can in general prevail and make itself permanent in constant struggle with its neighbours, or with rebellious or rebellion-threatening vassals. The most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists, in spite of all Gods and men, and has hitherto been victorious: these qualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone it develops to maturity. It does so with severity, indeed it desires severity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education of youth, in the control of women, in the marriage customs, in the relations of old and young, in the penal laws (which have an eye only for the degenerating): it counts intolerance itself among the virtues, under the name of justice. A type with few, but very marked features, a species of severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and reticent men (and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and nuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the vicissitudes of generations; the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLE conditions is, as already remarked, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
265 of 301 
the cause of a type becoming stable and hard. Finally, however, a happy state of things results, the enormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more enemies among the neighbouring peoples, and the means of life, even of the enjoyment of life, are present in superabundance. With one stroke the bond and constraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as necessary, as a condition of existenceif it would continue, it can only do so as a form of LUXURY, as an archaizing TASTE. Variations, whether they be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or deteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individual and detach himself. At this turning-point of history there manifest themselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving, a kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary decay and self- destruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms, which strive with one another for sun and light, and can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality. It was this morality itself which piled up the strength so 
Beyond Good and Evil  
266 of 301 
enormously, which bent the bow in so threatening a manner:it is now out of date, it is getting out of date. The dangerous and disquieting point has been reached when the greater, more manifold, more comprehensive life IS LIVED BEYOND the old morality; the individual stands out, and is obliged to have recourse to his own lawgiving, his own arts and artifices for self-preservation, selfelevation, and self-deliverance. Nothing but new Whys, nothing but new Hows, no common formulas any longer, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay, deterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled, the genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad, a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn, full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still inexhausted, still unwearied corruption. Danger is again present, the mother of morality, great danger; this time shifted into the individual, into the neighbour and friend, into the street, into their own child, into their own heart, into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions. What will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach? They discover, these sharp onlookers and loafers, that the end is quickly approaching, that everything around them decays and 
Beyond Good and Evil  
267 of 301 
produces decay, that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow, except one species of man, the incurably MEDIOCRE. The mediocre alone have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselvesthey will be the men of the future, the sole survivors; be like them! become mediocre! is now the only morality which has still a significance, which still obtains a hearing.But it is difficult to preach this morality of mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what it desires! it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly loveit will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY! 263. There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK, which more than anything else is already the sign of a HIGH rank; there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCES of reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits. The refinement, goodness, and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test when something passes by that is of the highest rank, but is not yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches and incivilities: something that goes its way like a living touchstone, undistinguished, undiscovered, and tentative, perhaps voluntarily veiled and disguised. He whose task and practice it is to investigate souls, will avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine the ultimate value of 
Beyond Good and Evil  
268 of 301 
a soul, the unalterable, innate order of rank to which it belongs: he will test it by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE. DIFFERENCE ENGENDRE HAINE: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like dirty water, when any holy vessel, any jewel from closed shrines, any book bearing the marks of great destiny, is brought before it; while on the other hand, there is an involuntary silence, a hesitation of the eye, a cessation of all gestures, by which it is indicated that a soul FEELS the nearness of what is worthiest of respect. The way in which, on the whole, the reverence for the BIBLE has hitherto been maintained in Europe, is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of manners which Europe owes to Christianity: books of such profoundness and supreme significance require for their protection an external tyranny of authority, in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousands of years which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them. Much has been achieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses (the shallow-pates and the boobies of every kind) that they are not allowed to touch everything, that there are holy experiences before which they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean handit is almost their highest advance towards humanity. On the contrary, in the so
Beyond Good and Evil  
269 of 301 
called cultured classes, the believers in modern ideas, nothing is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame, the easy insolence of eye and hand with which they touch, taste, and finger everything; and it is possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE nobility of taste, and more tact for reverence among the people, among the lower classes of the people, especially among peasants, than among the newspaper-reading DEMIMONDE of intellect, the cultured class. 264. It cannot be effaced from a mans soul what his ancestors have preferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligent economizers attached to a desk and a cash-box, modest and citizen-like in their desires, modest also in their virtues; or whether they were accustomed to commanding from morning till night, fond of rude pleasures and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities; or whether, finally, at one time or another, they have sacrificed old privileges of birth and possession, in order to live wholly for their faithfor their God,as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience, which blushes at every compromise. It is quite impossible for a man NOT to have the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his constitution, whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary. This is the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
270 of 301 
problem of race. Granted that one knows something of the parents, it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kind of offensive incontinence, any kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy self-vauntingthe three things which together have constituted the genuine plebeian type in all timessuch must pass over to the child, as surely as bad blood; and with the help of the best education and culture one will only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredity.And what else does education and culture try to do nowadays! In our very democratic, or rather, very plebeian age, education and culture MUST be essentially the art of deceivingdeceiving with regard to origin, with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul. An educator who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else, and called out constantly to his pupils: Be true! Be natural! Show yourselves as you are!even such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time to have recourse to the FURCA of Horace, NATURAM EXPELLERE: with what results? Plebeianism USQUE RECURRET. [FOOTNOTE: Horaces Epistles, I. x. 24.] 265. At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that egoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief that to a being such as we, other 
Beyond Good and Evil  
271 of 301 
beings must naturally be in subjection, and have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question, and also without consciousness of harshness, constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things:if he sought a designation for it he would say: It is justice itself. He acknowledges under certain circumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that there are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this question of rank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged ones with the same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect, which he enjoys in intercourse with himselfin accordance with an innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand. It is an ADDITIONAL instance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation in intercourse with his equalsevery star is a similar egoist; he honours HIMSELF in them, and in the rights which he concedes to them, he has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights, as the ESSENCE of all intercourse, belongs also to the natural condition of things. The noble soul gives as he takes, prompted by the passionate and sensitive instinct of requital, which is at the root of his nature. The notion of favour has, INTER PARES, neither significance nor good repute; there may 
Beyond Good and Evil  
272 of 301 
be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one from above, and of drinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for those arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude. His egoism hinders him here: in general, he looks aloft unwillinglyhe looks either FORWARD, horizontally and deliberately, or downwardsHE KNOWS THAT HE IS ON A HEIGHT. 266. One can only truly esteem him who does not LOOK OUT FOR himself.Goethe to Rath Schlosser. 267. The Chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children: SIAO-SIN ("MAKE THY HEART SMALL). This is the essentially fundamental tendency in latter-day civilizations. I have no doubt that an ancient Greek, also, would first of all remark the self-dwarfing in us Europeans of todayin this respect alone we should immediately be distasteful to him. 268. What, after all, is ignobleness?Words are vocal symbols for ideas; ideas, however, are more or less definite mental symbols for frequently returning and concurring sensations, for groups of sensations. It is not sufficient to use the same words in order to understand one another: we must also employ the same words for the same kind of internal experiences, we must in the end have experiences IN COMMON. On this account the people of one 
Beyond Good and Evil  
273 of 301 
nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations, even when they use the same language; or rather, when people have lived long together under similar conditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there ORIGINATES therefrom an entity that understands itselfnamely, a nation. In all souls a like number of frequently recurring experiences have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: about these matters people understand one another rapidly and always more rapidlythe history of language is the history of a process of abbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension people always unite closer and closer. The greater the danger, the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary; not to misunderstand one another in dangerthat is what cannot at all be dispensed with in intercourse. Also in all loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words, one of the two parties has feelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears different from those of the other. (The fear of the eternal misunderstanding": that is the good genius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from too hasty attachments, to which sense and heart prompt themand 
Beyond Good and Evil  
274 of 301 
NOT some Schopenhauerian genius of the species!) Whichever groups of sensations within a soul awaken most readily, begin to speak, and give the word of commandthese decide as to the general order of rank of its values, and determine ultimately its list of desirable things. A mans estimates of value betray something of the STRUCTURE of his soul, and wherein it sees its conditions of life, its intrinsic needs. Supposing now that necessity has from all time drawn together only such men as could express similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbols, it results on the whole that the easy COMMUNICABILITY of need, which implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and COMMON experiences, must have been the most potent of all the forces which have hitherto operated upon mankind. The more similar, the more ordinary people, have always had and are still having the advantage; the more select, more refined, more unique, and difficultly comprehensible, are liable to stand alone; they succumb to accidents in their isolation, and seldom propagate themselves. One must appeal to immense opposing forces, in order to thwart this natural, all-too-natural PROGRESSUS IN SIMILE, the evolution of man to the 
Beyond Good and Evil  
275 of 301 
similar, the ordinary, the average, the gregarious to the IGNOBLE! 269. The more a psychologista born, an unavoidable psychologist and soul-divinerturns his attention to the more select cases and individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy: he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. For the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a rule always before ones eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then discovers ALMOST repeatedly throughout all history, this universal inner desperateness of higher men, this eternal too late! in every sensemay perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at self-destructionof his going to ruin himself. One may perceive in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and incisivenessfrom what his businesshas laid upon his conscience. The fear of his memory is 
Beyond Good and Evil  
276 of 301 
peculiar to him. He is easily silenced by the judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour, admire, love, and glorify, where he has PERCEIVEDor he even conceals his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely where he has learnt GREAT SYMPATHY, together with great CONTEMPT, the multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt great reverence reverence for great men and marvelous animals, for the sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland, the earth, the dignity of mankind, and ones own self, to whom one points the young, and in view of whom one educates them. And who knows but in all great instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshipped a God, and that the God was only a poor sacrificial animal! SUCCESS has always been the greatest liarand the work itself is a success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in their creations until they are unrecognizable; the work of the artist, of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is REPUTED to have created it; the great men, as they are reverenced, are poor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical values 
Beyond Good and Evil  
277 of 301 
spurious coinage PREVAILS. Those great poets, for example, such as Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not venture to mention much greater names, but I have them in my mind), as they now appear, and were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous, and childish, light- minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust; with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking revenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the Will-o-the-Wisps around the swamps, and PRETEND TO BE starsthe people then call them idealists,often struggling with protracted disgust, with an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes them cold, and obliges them to languish for GLORIA and devour faith as it is out of the hands of intoxicated adulators:what a TORMENT these great artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once found them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from womanwho is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also unfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her powersthat THEY have learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted 
Beyond Good and Evil  
278 of 301 
SYMPATHY, which the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand, and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. This sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would like to believe that love can do EVERYTHINGit is the SUPERSTITION peculiar to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor, helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love ishe finds that it rather DESTROYS than saves!It is possible that under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE: the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that never had enough of any human love, that DEMANDED love, that demanded inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible outbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor soul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send thither those who WOULD NOT love himand that at last, enlightened about human love, had to invent a God who is entire love, entire CAPACITY for lovewho takes pity on human love, because it is so paltry, so ignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such KNOWLEDGE about loveSEEKS for death!But 
Beyond Good and Evil  
279 of 301 
why should one deal with such painful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to do so. 270. The intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who has suffered deeplyit almost determines the order of rank HOW deeply men can sufferthe chilling certainty, with which he is thoroughly imbued and coloured, that by virtue of his suffering he KNOWS MORE than the shrewdest and wisest can ever know, that he has been familiar with, and at home in, many distant, dreadful worlds of which YOU know nothing!this silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer, this pride of the elect of knowledge, of the initiated, of the almost sacrificed, finds all forms of disguise necessary to protect itself from contact with officious and sympathizing hands, and in general from all that is not its equal in suffering. Profound suffering makes noble: it separates.One of the most refined forms of disguise is Epicurism, along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste, which takes suffering lightly, and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound. They are gay men who make use of gaiety, because they are misunderstood on account of itthey WISH to be misunderstood. There are scientific minds who make use of science, because it gives a gay appearance, and because scientificness leads to 
Beyond Good and Evil  
280 of 301 
the conclusion that a person is superficialthey WISH to mislead to a false conclusion. There are free insolent minds which would fain conceal and deny that they are broken, proud, incurable hearts (the cynicism of Hamletthe case of Galiani); and occasionally folly itself is the mask of an unfortunate OVER- ASSURED knowledge.From which it follows that it is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence for the mask, and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place. 271. That which separates two men most profoundly is a different sense and grade of purity. What does it matter about all their honesty and reciprocal usefulness, what does it matter about all their mutual good-will: the fact still remainsthey cannot smell each other! The highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous isolation, as a saint: for it is just holinessthe highest spiritualization of the instinct in question. Any kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath, any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out of night into the morning, and out of gloom, out of affliction into clearness, brightness, depth, and refinement:just as much as such a tendency DISTINGUISHESit is a noble tendencyit also 
Beyond Good and Evil  
281 of 301 
SEPARATES.The pity of the saint is pity for the FILTH of the human, all-too-human. And there are grades and heights where pity itself is regarded by him as impurity, as filth. 272. Signs of nobility: never to think of lowering our duties to the rank of duties for everybody; to be unwilling to renounce or to share our responsibilities; to count our prerogatives, and the exercise of them, among our DUTIES. 273. A man who strives after great things, looks upon every one whom he encounters on his way either as a means of advance, or a delay and hindranceor as a temporary resting-place. His peculiar lofty BOUNTY to his fellow-men is only possible when he attains his elevation and dominates. Impatience, and the consciousness of being always condemned to comedy up to that timefor even strife is a comedy, and conceals the end, as every means doesspoil all intercourse for him; this kind of man is acquainted with solitude, and what is most poisonous in it. 274. THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO WAIT. Happy chances are necessary, and many incalculable elements, in order that a higher man in whom the solution of a problem is dormant, may yet take action, or break 
Beyond Good and Evil  
282 of 301 
forth, as one might sayat the right moment. On an average it DOES NOT happen; and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting who hardly know to what extent they are waiting, and still less that they wait in vain. Occasionally, too, the waking call comes too late the chance which gives permission to take actionwhen their best youth, and strength for action have been used up in sitting still; and how many a one, just as he sprang up, has found with horror that his limbs are benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy! It is too late, he has said to himselfand has become self-distrustful and henceforth for ever useless.In the domain of genius, may not the Raphael without hands (taking the expression in its widest sense) perhaps not be the exception, but the rule?Perhaps genius is by no means so rare: but rather the five hundred HANDS which it requires in order to tyrannize over the [GREEK INSERTED HERE], the right timein order to take chance by the forelock! 275. He who does not WISH to see the height of a man, looks all the more sharply at what is low in him, and in the foreground and thereby betrays himself. 276. In all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is better off than the nobler soul: the dangers of the latter must be greater, the probability that it will

come to grief and perish is in fact immense, considering the multiplicity of the conditions of its existence.In a lizard a finger grows again which has been lost; not so in man. 277. It is too bad! Always the old story! When a man has finished building his house, he finds that he has learnt unawares something which he OUGHT absolutely to have known before he began to build. The eternal, fatal Too late! The melancholia of everything COMPLETED! 278.Wanderer, who art thou? I see thee follow thy path without scorn, without love, with unfathomable eyes, wet and sad as a plummet which has returned to the light insatiated out of every depthwhat did it seek down there?with a bosom that never sighs, with lips that conceal their loathing, with a hand which only slowly grasps: who art thou? what hast thou done? Rest thee here: this place has hospitality for every onerefresh thyself! And whoever thou art, what is it that now pleases thee? What will serve to refresh thee? Only name it, whatever I have I offer thee! To refresh me? To refresh me? Oh, thou prying one, what sayest thou! But give me, I pray thee- What? what? Speak out! Another mask! A second mask!

Bad! Bad! What? Does he notgo back? Yes! But you misunderstand him when you complain about it. He goes back like every one who is about to make a great spring. 281.Will people believe it of me? But I insist that they believe it of me: I have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about myself, only in very rare cases, only compulsorily, always without delight in the subject, ready to digress from myself, and always without faith in the result, owing to an unconquerable distrust of the POSSIBILITY of self- knowledge, which has led me so far as to feel a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO even in the idea of direct knowledge which theorists allow themselves:this matter of fact is almost the most certain thing I know about myself. There must be a sort of repugnance in me to BELIEVE anything definite about myself.Is there perhaps some enigma therein? Probably; but fortunately nothing for my own

To famish apart? To suffocate with his memories?To him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul, and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared, the danger will always be greatnowadays, however, it is extraordinarily so. Thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age, with which he does not like to eat out of the same dish, he may readily perish of hunger and thirstor, should he nevertheless finally fall to, of sudden nausea.We have probably all sat at tables to which we did not belong; and precisely the most spiritual of us, who are most difficult to nourish, know the dangerous DYSPEPSIA which originates from a sudden insight and disillusionment about our food and our messmatesthe AFTER-DINNER NAUSEA.

283. If one wishes to praise at all, it is a delicate and at the same time a noble self-control, to praise only where one DOES NOT agreeotherwise in fact one would praise oneself, which is contrary to good taste:a selfcontrol, to be sure, which offers excellent opportunity and provocation to constant MISUNDERSTANDING. To be able to allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality, one must not live among intellectual imbeciles, but rather among men whose misunderstandings and mistakes amuse by their refinementor one will have to pay dearly for it!He praises me, THEREFORE he acknowledges me to be rightthis asinine method of inference spoils half of the life of us recluses, for it brings the asses into our neighbourhood and friendship. 284. To live in a vast and proud tranquility; always beyond  To have, or not to have, ones emotions, ones For and Against, according to choice; to lower oneself to them for hours; to SEAT oneself on them as upon horses, and often as upon asses:for one must know how to make use of their stupidity as well as of their fire. To conserve ones three hundred foregrounds; also ones black spectacles: for there are circumstances when nobody must look into our eyes, still less into our motives. And to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice, 
Beyond Good and Evil  
287 of 301 
politeness. And to remain master of ones four virtues, courage, insight, sympathy, and solitude. For solitude is a virtue with us, as a sublime bent and bias to purity, which divines that in the contact of man and manin society it must be unavoidably impure. All society makes one somehow, somewhere, or sometimecommonplace. 285. The greatest events and thoughtsthe greatest thoughts, however, are the greatest eventsare longest in being comprehended: the generations which are contemporary with them do not EXPERIENCE such eventsthey live past them. Something happens there as in the realm of stars. The light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man; and before it has arrived man DENIESthat there are stars there. How many centuries does a mind require to be understood?that is also a standard, one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewith, such as is necessary for mind and for star. 286. Here is the prospect free, the mind exalted. [FOOTNOTE: Goethes Faust, Part II, Act V. The words of Dr. Marianus.] But there is a reverse kind of man, who is also upon a height, and has also a free prospectbut looks DOWNWARDS. 
Beyond Good and Evil  
288 of 301 
287. What is noble? What does the word noble still mean for us nowadays? How does the noble man betray himself, how is he recognized under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism, by which everything is rendered opaque and leaden? It is not his actions which establish his claimactions are always ambiguous, always inscrutable; neither is it his works. One finds nowadays among artists and scholars plenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing for nobleness impels them; but this very NEED of nobleness is radically different from the needs of the noble soul itself, and is in fact the eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof. It is not the works, but the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines the order of rankto employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper meaningit is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, is not to be lost. THE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR ITSELF. 288. There are men who are unavoidably intellectual, let them turn and twist themselves as they will, and hold their hands before their treacherous eyesas though the hand were not a betrayer; it always comes out at last that 
Beyond Good and Evil  
289 of 301 
they have something which they hidenamely, intellect. One of the subtlest means of deceiving, at least as long as possible, and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider than one really iswhich in everyday life is often as desirable as an umbrella,is called ENTHUSIASM, including what belongs to it, for instance, virtue. For as Galiani said, who was obliged to know it: VERTU EST ENTHOUSIASME. 289. In the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echo of the wilderness, something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance of solitude; in his strongest words, even in his cry itself, there sounds a new and more dangerous kind of silence, of concealment. He who has sat day and night, from years end to years end, alone with his soul in familiar discord and discourse, he who has become a cave-bear, or a treasure- seeker, or a treasure-guardian and dragon in his caveit may be a labyrinth, but can also be a gold-minehis ideas themselves eventually acquire a twilight-colour of their own, and an odour, as much of the depth as of the mould, something uncommunicative and repulsive, which blows chilly upon every passerby. The recluse does not believe that a philosophersupposing that a philosopher has always in the first place been a recluseever expressed his 
Beyond Good and Evil  
290 of 301 
actual and ultimate opinions in books: are not books written precisely to hide what is in us?indeed, he will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have ultimate and actual opinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not, and must necessarily be, a still deeper cave: an ampler, stranger, richer world beyond the surface, an abyss behind every bottom, beneath every foundation. Every philosophy is a foreground philosophythis is a recluses verdict: There is something arbitrary in the fact that the PHILOSOPHER came to a stand here, took a retrospect, and looked around; that he HERE laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeperthere is also something suspicious in it. Every philosophy also CONCEALS a philosophy; every opinion is also a LURKING-PLACE, every word is also a MASK. 290. Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood. The latter perhaps wounds his vanity; but the former wounds his heart, his sympathy, which always says: Ah, why would you also have as hard a time of it as I have? 291. Man, a COMPLEX, mendacious, artful, and inscrutable animal, uncanny to the other animals by his artifice and sagacity, rather than by his strength, has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his 
Beyond Good and Evil  
291 of 301 
soul as something SIMPLE; and the whole of morality is a long, audacious falsification, by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of the soul becomes possible. From this point of view there is perhaps much more in the conception of art than is generally believed. 292. A philosopher: that is a man who constantly experiences, sees, hears, suspects, hopes, and dreams extraordinary things; who is struck by his own thoughts as if they came from the outside, from above and below, as a species of events and lightning-flashes PECULIAR TO HIM; who is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings; a portentous man, around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and something uncanny going on. A philosopher: alas, a being who often runs away from himself, is often afraid of himselfbut whose curiosity always makes him come to himself again. 293. A man who says: I like that, I take it for my own, and mean to guard and protect it from every one"; a man who can conduct a case, carry out a resolution, remain true to an opinion, keep hold of a woman, punish and overthrow insolence; a man who has his indignation and his sword, and to whom the weak, the suffering, the oppressed, and even the animals willingly submit and naturally belong; in short, a man who is a MASTER by 
Beyond Good and Evil  
292 of 301 
nature when such a man has sympathy, well! THAT sympathy has value! But of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer! Or of those even who preach sympathy! There is nowadays, throughout almost the whole of Europe, a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain, and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining, an effeminizing, which, with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense, seeks to deck itself out as something superiorthere is a regular cult of suffering. The UNMANLINESS of that which is called sympathy by such groups of visionaries, is always, I believe, the first thing that strikes the eye.One must resolutely and radically taboo this latest form of bad taste; and finally I wish people to put the good amulet, GAI SABER ("gay science, in ordinary language), on heart and neck, as a protection against it. 294. THE OLYMPIAN VICE.Despite the philosopher who, as a genuine Englishman, tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking mindsLaughing is a bad infirmity of human nature, which every thinking mind will strive to overcome (Hobbes),I would even allow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of their laughingup to those who are capable of GOLDEN laughter.

philosophize, which I am strongly inclined to believe, owing to many reasonsI have no doubt that they also know how to laugh thereby in an overman-like and new fashionand at the expense of all serious things! Gods are fond of ridicule: it seems that they cannot refrain from laughter even in holy matters. 295. The genius of the heart, as that great mysterious one possesses it, the tempter-god and born rat-catcher of consciences, whose voice can descend into the netherworld of every soul, who neither speaks a word nor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch of allurement, to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to appear,not as he is, but in a guise which acts as an ADDITIONAL constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him, to follow him more cordially and thoroughly;the genius of the heart, which imposes silence and attention on everything loud and selfconceited, which smoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longingto lie placid as a mirror, that the deep heavens may be reflected in them;the genius of the heart, which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate, and to grasp more delicately; which scents the hidden and forgotten treasure, the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark ice, and is a divining-

rod for every grain of gold, long buried and imprisoned in mud and sand; the genius of the heart, from contact with which every one goes away richer; not favoured or surprised, not as though gratified and oppressed by the good things of others; but richer in himself, newer than before, broken up, blown upon, and sounded by a thawing wind; more uncertain, perhaps, more delicate, more fragile, more bruised, but full of hopes which as yet lack names, full of a new will and current, full of a new illwill and counter-current  but what am I doing, my friends? Of whom am I talking to you? Have I forgotten myself so far that I have not even told you his name? Unless it be that you have already divined of your own accord who this questionable God and spirit is, that wishes to be PRAISED in such a manner? For, as it happens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his legs, and in foreign lands, I have also encountered on my path many strange and dangerous spirits; above all, however, and again and again, the one of whom I have just spoken: in fact, no less a personage than the God DIONYSUS, the great equivocator and tempter, to whom, as you know, I once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first-fruitsthe last, as it seems to me, who has offered a SACRIFICE to him, for I have found no

one who could understand what I was then doing. In the meantime, however, I have learned much, far too much, about the philosophy of this God, and, as I said, from mouth to mouthI, the last disciple and initiate of the God Dionysus: and perhaps I might at last begin to give you, my friends, as far as I am allowed, a little taste of this philosophy? In a hushed voice, as is but seemly: for it has to do with much that is secret, new, strange, wonderful, and uncanny. The very fact that Dionysus is a philosopher, and that therefore Gods also philosophize, seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers;among you, my friends, there is less to be said against it, except that it comes too late and not at the right time; for, as it has been disclosed to me, you are loth nowadays to believe in God and gods. It may happen, too, that in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the strict usages of your ears? Certainly the God in question went further, very much further, in such dialogues, and was always many paces ahead of me  Indeed, if it were allowed, I should have to give him, according to human usage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, I should have to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless honesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. But

such a God does not know what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. Keep that, he would say, for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require it! Ihave no reason to cover my nakedness! One suspects that this kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame?He once said: Under certain circumstances I love mankindand referred thereby to Ariadne, who was present; in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave, inventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his way even through all labyrinths. I like man, and often think how I can still further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more profound.Stronger, more evil, and more profound? I asked in horror. Yes, he said again, stronger, more evil, and more profound; also more beautifuland thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile, as though he had just paid some charming compliment. One here sees at once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks;and in general there are good grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could all of them come to us men for instruction. We men aremore human. 296. Alas! what are you, after all, my written and painted thoughts! Not long ago you were so variegated, young and malicious, so full of thorns and secret spices,

that you made me sneeze and laughand now? You have already doffed your novelty, and some of you, I fear, are ready to become truths, so immortal do they look, so pathetically honest, so tedious! And was it ever otherwise? What then do we write and paint, we mandarins with Chinese brush, we immortalisers of things which LEND themselves to writing, what are we alone capable of painting? Alas, only that which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour! Alas, only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments! Alas, only birds strayed and fatigued by flight, which now let themselves be captured with the handwith OUR hand! We immortalize what cannot live and fly much longer, things only which are exhausted and mellow! And it is only for your AFTERNOON, you, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone I have colours, many colours, perhaps, many variegated softenings, and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds; but nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and marvels of my solitude, you, my old, beloved EVIL thoughts!

The Horror in Clay
Of such great powers or beings there may be conceivably a survival ... a survival of a hugely remote period when ... consciousness was manifested, perhaps, in shapes and forms long since withdrawn before the tide of advancing humanity ... forms of which poetry and legend alone have caught a ?ying memory and called them gods, monsters, mythical beings of all sorts and kinds ...
 Algernon Blackwood
The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of in?nity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or ?ee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age. Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. But it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of forbidden aeons which chills me when I think of it and maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, ?ashed out from an accidental piecing together of separated things in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of a dead professor. I hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out; certainly, if I live, I shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain. I think that the professor, too, intended to keep silent regarding the part he knew, and that he would have destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him.
1
My knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926-27 with the death of my grand-uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions, and had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so that his passing at the age of ninety-two may be recalled by many. Locally, interest was intensi?ed by the obscurity of the cause of death. The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the Newport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical-looking Negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceaseds home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable to ?nd any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but latterly I am inclined to wonderand more than wonder. As my grand-uncles heir and executor, for he died a childless widower, I was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose moved his entire set of ?les and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the material which I correlated will be later published by the American Archaeological Society, but there was one box which I found exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much averse from shewing to other eyes. It had been locked, and I did not ?nd the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the professor carried always in his pocket. Then indeed I succeeded in opening it, but when I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the queer clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which I found? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most super?cial impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent disturbance of an old mans peace of mind. The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about ?ve by six inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild, they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing. And writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory, despite much familiarity with the papers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this particular species, or even hint at its remotest a?liations. Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a ?gure of evidently pictorial intent, though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature. It seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could conceive. If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus,
2
a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing. A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful. Behind the ?gure was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopean architectural background. The writing accompanying this oddity was, aside from a stack of press cuttings, in Professor Angells most recent hand; and made no pretense to literary style. What seemed to be the main document was headed CTHULHU CULT in characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word so unheard-of. This manuscript was divided into two sections, the ?rst of which was headed 1925Dream and Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox, 7 Thomas St., Providence, R.I., and the second, Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, 121 Bienville St., New Orleans, La., at 1908 A.A.S. Mtg.Notes on Same, & Prof. Webbs Acct. The other manuscript papers were all brief notes, some of them accounts of the queer dreams of di?erent persons, some of them citations from theosophical books and magazines (notably W. Scott Elliots Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria), and the rest comments on long-surviving secret societies and hidden cults, with references to passages in such mythological and anthropological source-books as Frazers Golden Bough and Miss Murrays Witch-Cult in Western Europe. The cuttings largely alluded to outre mental illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925. The ?rst half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale. It appears that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon Professor Angell bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and fresh. His card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle had recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near that institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity, and had from childhood excited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating. He called himself psychically hypersensitive, but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely queer. Never mingling much with his kind, he had dropped gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of aesthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its conservatism, had found him quite hopeless. On the occasion of the visit, ran the professors manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for the bene?t of his hosts archaeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy; and my uncle shewed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archaeology. Young Wilcoxs rejoinder,
3
which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typi?ed his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon. It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years; and Wilcoxs imagination had been keenly a?ected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of titan blocks and sky-?ung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters, Cthulhu fhtagn. This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scienti?c minuteness; and studied with almost frantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad only in his night-clothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness in recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design. Many of his questions seemed highly out-of-place to his visitor, especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was o?ered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor Angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the ?rst interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters Cthulhu and Rlyeh. On March 23rd, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other artists in the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close watch of the case; calling often at the Thayer Street o?ce of Dr. Tobey,
4
whom he learned to be in charge. The youths febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them. They included not only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing miles high which walked or lumbered about. He at no time fully described this object, but occasional frantic words, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream-sculpture. Reference to this object, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young mans subsidence into lethargy. His temperature, oddly enough, was not greatly above normal; but his whole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder. On April 2nd at about 3 p.m. every trace of Wilcoxs malady suddenly ceased. He sat upright in bed, astonished to ?nd himself at home and completely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the night of March 22nd. Pronounced well by his physician, he returned to his quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no further assistance. All traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery, and my uncle kept no record of his night-thoughts after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions. Here the ?rst part of the manuscript ended, but references to certain of the scattered notes gave me much material for thoughtso much, in fact, that only the ingrained scepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist. The notes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young Wilcox had had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously far-?ung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of his request seems to have been varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary. This original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and really signi?cant digest. Average people in society and businessNew Englands traditional salt of the earthgave an almost completely negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions appear here and there, always between March 23rd and April 2ndthe period of young Wilcoxs delirium. Scienti?c men were little more a?ected, though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormal. It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As it was, lacking their original letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see. That is why I contin
5
ued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from aesthetes told a disturbing tale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptors delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on the date of young Wilcoxs seizure, and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the professors questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever reach them. The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell must have employed a cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here was a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A despatch from California describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some glorious ful?llment which never arrives, whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March. Voodoo orgies multiply in Hayti, and African outposts report ominous mutterings. American o?cers in the Philippines ?nd certain tribes bothersome at this time, and New York policemen are mobbed by hysterical Levantines on the night of March 22-23. The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild rumour and legendry, and a fantastic painter named Ardois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous Dream Landscape in the Paris spring salon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane asylums, that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mysti?ed conclusions. A weird bunch of cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with which I set them aside. But I was then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor.

Chapter 2
The Tale of Inspector Legrasse
The older matters which had made the sculptors dream and bas-relief so signi?cant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript. Once before, it appears, Professor Angell had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as Cthulhu; and all this in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he pursued young Wilcox with queries and demands for data. This earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the American Archaeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis. Professor Angell, as be?tted one of his authority and attainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was one of the ?rst to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to o?er questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution. The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had travelled all the way from New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source. His name was John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector of Police. With him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss to determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least interest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it, that the police could not but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them, and in?nitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin,
7
apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head. Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his o?ering created. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a state of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive ?gure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas. No recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone. The ?gure, which was ?nally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the centre, whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the crouchers elevated knees. The aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the more subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown. Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was unmistakable; yet not one link did it shew with any known type of art belonging to civilisations youthor indeed to any other time. Totally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the soapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent ?ecks and striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy. The characters along the base were equally ba?ing; and no member present, despite a representation of half the worlds expert learning in this ?eld, could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship. They, like the subject and material, belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it; something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our conceptions have no part. And yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the Inspectors problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some di?dence of the odd tri?e he knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropol
8
ogy in Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Esquimaux whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which other Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made. Besides nameless rites and human sacri?ces there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cli?s. It was, the professor stated, a very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing. And so far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting. This data, received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members, proved doubly exciting to Inspector Legrasse; and he began at once to ply his informant with questions. Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp cult-worshippers his men had arrested, he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist Esquimaux. There then followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart. What, in substance, both the Esquimaux wizards and the Louisiana swamp-priests had chanted to their kindred idols was something very like thisthe word-divisions being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted aloud:
Phnglui mglwnafh Cthulhu Rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn.
Legrasse had one point in advance of Professor Webb, for several among his mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant. This text, as given, ran something like this:
In his house at Rlyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.
And now, in response to a general and urgent demand, Inspector Legrasse related as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers; telling a story to which I could see my uncle attached profound signi?cance. It savoured of the wildest dreams of mythmaker and theosophist, and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such half-castes and pariahs as might be least expected to possess it.

On November 1st, 1907, there had come to the New Orleans police a frantic summons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south. The squatters there, mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of La?ttes men, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-?ames; and, the frightened messenger added, the people could stand it no more. So a body of twenty police, ?lling two carriages and an automobile, had set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the passable road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensi?ed by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns. The mu?ed beat of tomtoms was now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to ?lter through pale undergrowth beyond the endless avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before. The region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute, substantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and squatters whispered that batwinged devils ?ew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight. They said it had been there before dIberville, before La Salle, before the Indians, and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself, and to see it was to die. But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep away. The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terri?ed the squatters more than the shocking sounds and incidents. Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasses men as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and mu?ed tom-toms. There are vocal qualities peculiar to men, and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source
10
should yield the other. Animal fury and orgiastic license here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstacies that tore and reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell. Now and then the less organized ululation would cease, and from what seemed a well-drilled chorus of hoarse voices would rise in sing-song chant that hideous phrase or ritual: Phnglui mglwnafh Cthulhu Rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn. Then the men, having reached a spot where the trees were thinner, came suddenly in sight of the spectacle itself. Four of them reeled, one fainted, and two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened. Legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man, and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horror. In a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acres extent, clear of trees and tolerably dry. On this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola could paint. Void of clothing, this hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing, and writhing about a monstrous ring-shaped bon?re; in the centre of which, revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of ?ame, stood a great granite monolith some eight feet in height; on top of which, incongruous in its diminutiveness, rested the noxious carven statuette. From a wide circle of ten sca?olds set up at regular intervals with the ?ame-girt monolith as a centre hung, head downward, the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared. It was inside this circle that the ring of worshippers jumped and roared, the general direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless Bacchanal between the ring of bodies and the ring of ?re. It may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced one of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror. This man, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative. He indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest treesbut I suppose he had been hearing too much native superstition. Actually, the horri?ed pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration. Duty came ?rst; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the throng, the police relied on their ?rearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout. For ?ve minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description. Wild blows were struck, shots were ?red, and escapes were made; but in the end Legrasse was able to count some forty-seven sullen prisoners, whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows of policemen. Five of the worshippers lay dead, and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by
11
their fellow-prisoners. The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removed and carried back by Legrasse. Examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness, the prisoners all proved to be men of a very low, mixed-blooded, and mentally aberrant type. Most were seamen, and a sprinkling of Negroes and mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape Verde Islands, gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult. But before many questions were asked, it became manifest that something far deeper and older than Negro fetichism was involved. Degraded and ignorant as they were, the creatures held with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith. They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the ?rst men, who formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of Rlyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate him. Meanwhile no more must be told. There was a secret which even torture could not extract. Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth, for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few. But these were not the Great Old Ones. No man had ever seen the Old Ones. The carven idol was great Cthulhu, but none might say whether or not the others were precisely like him. No one could read the old writing now, but things were told by word of mouth. The chanted ritual was not the secretthat was never spoken aloud, only whispered. The chant meant only this: In his house at Rlyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming. Only two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged, and the rest were committed to various institutions. All denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred that the killing had been done by Black Winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial meeting-place in the haunted wood. But of those mysterious allies no coherent account could ever be gained. What the police did extract, came mainly from the immensely aged mestizo named Castro, who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult in the mountains of China. Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been aeons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities. Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean stones on islands
12
in the Paci?c. They all died vast epochs of time before men came, but there were arts which could revive Them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity. They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought Their images with Them. These Great Old Ones, Castro continued, were not composed altogether of ?esh and blood. They had shapefor did not this star-fashioned image prove it?but that shape was not made of matter. When the stars were right, They could plunge from world to world through the sky; but when the stars were wrong, They could not live. But although They no longer lived, They would never really die. They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of Rlyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for Them. But at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate Their bodies. The spells that preserved Them intact likewise prevented Them from making an initial move, and They could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by. They knew all that was occurring in the universe, for Their mode of speech was transmitted thought. Even now They talked in Their tombs. When, after in?nities of chaos, the ?rst men came, the Great Old Ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding their dreams; for only thus could Their language reach the ?eshly minds of mammals. Then, whispered Castro, those ?rst men formed the cult around small idols which the Great Ones shewed them; idols brought in dim eras from dark stars. That cult would never die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would ?ame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return. In the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed Old Ones in dreams, but then something happened. The great stone city Rlyeh, with its monoliths and sepulchres, had sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which not even thought can pass, had cut o? the spectral intercourse. But memory never died, and the high-priests said that the city would rise again when the stars were right. Then came out of the earth the black spirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked up in caverns beneath forgotten sea-bottoms. But of them old Castro dared not speak much. He cut himself o? hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction. The size of the Old Ones, too, he curiously declined to mention. Of the cult, he said
13
that he thought the centre lay amid the pathless desert of Arabia, where Irem, the City of Pillars, dreams hidden and untouched. It was not allied to the European witch-cult, and was virtually unknown beyond its members. No book had ever really hinted of it, though the deathless Chinamen said that there were double meanings in the Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred which the initiated might read as they chose, especially the much-discussed couplet:
That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die.
Legrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vain concerning the historic a?liations of the cult. Castro, apparently, had told the truth when he said that it was wholly secret. The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light upon either cult or image, and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the country and met with no more than the Greenland tale of Professor Webb. The feverish interest aroused at the meeting by Legrasses tale, corroborated as it was by the statuette, is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who attended; although scant mention occurs in the formal publications of the society. Caution is the ?rst care of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture. Legrasse for some time lent the image to Professor Webb, but at the latters death it was returned to him and remains in his possession, where I viewed it not long ago. It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably akin to the dream-sculpture of young Wilcox. That my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for what thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had learned of the cult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the ?gure and exact hieroglyphics of the swamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come in his dreams upon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by Esquimau diabolists and mongrel Louisianans? Professor Angells instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncles expense. The dream-narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions. So, after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man.
14
Wilcox still lived alone in the Fleur-de-Lys Building in Thomas Street, a hideous Victorian imitation of seventeenth-century Breton architecture which ?aunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill, and under the very shadow of the ?nest Georgian steeple in America, I found him at work in his rooms, and at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic. He will, I believe, some time be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallised in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which Arthur Machen evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in verse and in painting. Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock and asked me my business without rising. When I told him who I was, he displayed some interest; for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams, yet had never explained the reason for the study. I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought with some subtlety to draw him out. In a short time I became convinced of his absolute sincerity, for he spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake. They and their subconscious residuum had in?uenced his art profoundly, and he shewed me a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion. He could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dream bas-relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands. It was, no doubt, the giant shape he had raved of in delirium. That he really knew nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncles relentless catechism had let fall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which he could possibly have received the weird impressions. He talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion; making me see with terrible vividness the damp Cyclopean city of slimy green stone whose geometry, he oddly said, was all wrongand hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless, half-mental calling from underground: Cthulhu fhtagn, Cthulhu fhtagn. These words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead Cthulhus dream-vigil in his stone vault at Rlyeh, and I felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs. Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and imagining. Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression in dreams, in the bas-relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one. The youth was of a type, at once slightly a?ected and slightly ill-mannered, which I could never like, but I was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty. I took leave of him amicably, and wish him all the success his talent promises. The matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me, and at times I had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connexions. I visited New Orleans, talked with Legrasse and others of that old-time
15
raiding-party, saw the frightful image, and even questioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived. Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for some years. What I now heard so graphically at ?rst-hand, though it was really no more than a detailed con?rmation of what my uncle had written, excited me afresh; for I felt sure that I was on the track of a very real, very secret, and very ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist of note. My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as I wish it still were, and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by Professor Angell. One thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my uncles death was far from natural. He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a Negro sailor. I did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the cult-members in Louisiana, and would not be surprised to learn of secret methods and rites and beliefs. Legrasse and his men, it is true, have been let alone; but in Norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead. Might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptors data have come to sinister ears? I think Professor Angell died because he knew too much, or because he was likely to learn too much. Whether I shall go as he did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now.

Chapter 3
The Madness from the Sea
If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total e?acing of the results of a mere chance which ?xed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelfpaper. It was nothing on which I would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round, for it was an old number of an Australian journal, the Sydney Bulletin for April 18, 1925. It had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncles research. I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the Cthulhu Cult, and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note. Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend had wide a?liations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found in the swamp. Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in detail; and was disappointed to ?nd it of only moderate length. What it suggested, however, was of portentous signi?cance to my ?agging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate action. It read as follows:
MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA
Vigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow.
One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of Desperate
Battle and Deaths at Sea.
Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange Experience.
Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to Follow.
17
The Morrison Co.s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin, N.Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34? 210, W. Longitude 152? 170 with one living and one dead man aboard. The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week. The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about a foot in height, regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the Museum in College Street all profess complete ba?ement, and which the survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern. This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of piracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been second mate of the twomasted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February 20th with a complement of eleven men. The Emma, he says, was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the great storm of March 1st, and on March 22nd, in S. Latitude 49? 510 W. Longitude 128? 340, encountered the Alert, manned by a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes. Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt. Collins refused; whereupon the strange crew began to ?re savagely and without warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yachts equipment. The Emmas men shewed ?ght, says the survivor, and though the schooner began to sink from shots beneath the waterline they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her, grappling with the savage crew on the yachts deck, and being forced to kill them all, the number being slightly superior, because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of ?ghting. Three of the Emmas men, including Capt. Collins and First Mate Green, were killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering back had existed. The next day, it appears, they raised
18
and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm. Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage her, but were beaten about by the storm of April 2nd. From that time till his rescue on the 12th the man remembers little, and he does not even recall when William Briden, his companion, died. Bridens death reveals no apparent cause, and was probably due to excitement or exposure. Cable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an island trader, and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront. It was owned by a curious group of half-castes whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of March 1st. Our Auckland correspondent gives the Emma and her crew an excellent reputation, and Johansen is described as a sober and worthy man. The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning tomorrow, at which every e?ort will be made to induce Johansen to speak more freely than he has done hitherto.
This was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a train of ideas it started in my mind! Here were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land. What motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the Emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol? What was the unknown island on which six of the Emmas crew had died, and about which the mate Johansen was so secretive? What had the vice-admiraltys investigation brought out, and what was known of the noxious cult in Dunedin? And most marvellous of all, what deep and more than natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable signi?cance to the various turns of events so carefully noted by my uncle? March 1stour February 28th according to the International Date Line the earthquake and storm had come. From Dunedin the Alert and her noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned, and on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange, dank Cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had moulded in his sleep the form of the dreaded Cthulhu. March 23rd the crew of the Emma landed on an unknown island and left six men dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monsters malign pursuit, whilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium! And what of this storm of April 2ndthe date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox
19
emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange fever? What of all this and of those hints of old Castro about the sunken, star-born Old Ones and their coming reign; their faithful cult and their mastery of dreams? Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond mans power to bear? If so, they must be horrors of the mind alone, for in some way the second of April had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankinds soul. That evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host adieu and took a train for San Francisco. In less than a month I was in Dunedin; where, however, I found that little was known of the strange cult-members who had lingered in the old sea-taverns. Waterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though there was vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made, during which faint drumming and red ?ame were noted on the distant hills. In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hair turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney, and had thereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old home in Oslo. Of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty o?cials, and all they could do was to give me his Oslo address. After that I went to Sydney and talked pro?tlessly with seamen and members of the vice-admiralty court. I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its non-committal bulk. The crouching image with its cuttle?sh head, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the Museum at Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well, ?nding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship, and with the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness of material which I had noted in Legrasses smaller specimen. Geologists, the curator told me, had found it a monstrous puzzle; for they vowed that the world held no rock like it. Then I thought with a shudder of what Old Castro had told Legrasse about the Great Ones; They had come from the stars, and had brought Their images with Them. Shaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now resolved to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Sailing for London, I reembarked at once for the Norwegian capital; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg. Johansens address, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as Christiana. I made the brief trip by taxicab, and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and ancient building with plastered front. A sad-faced woman in black answered my summons, and I was stung with disappointment when she told me in halting English that Gustaf Johansen was no more. He had not long survived his return, said his wife, for the doings at sea in 1925 had broken him. He had told her no more than he had told the public,
20
but had left a long manuscriptof technical matters as he saidwritten in English, evidently in order to safeguard her from the peril of casual perusal. During a walk through a narrow lane near the Gothenburg dock, a bundle of papers falling from an attic window had knocked him down. Two Lascar sailors at once helped him to his feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead. Physicians found no adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitution. I now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me till I, too, am at rest; accidentally or otherwise. Persuading the widow that my connexion with her husbands technical matters was su?cient to entitle me to his manuscript, I bore the document away and began to read it on the London boat. It was a simple, rambling thinga naive sailors e?ort at a post-facto diaryand strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage. I cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to shew why the sound of the water against the vessels sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped my ears with cotton. Johansen, thank God, did not know quite all, even though he saw the city and the Thing, but I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space, and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea, known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them on the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and air. Johansens voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force of that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that ?lled mens dreams. Once more under control, the ship was making good progress when held up by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mates regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-?ends on the Alert he speaks with signi?cant horror. There was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under Johansens command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47? 90, W. Longitude 126? 430 come upon a coast-line of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earths supreme terrorthe nightmare corpse-city of Rlyeh, that was built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive
21
and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration. All this Johansen did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough! I suppose that only a single mountain-top, the hideous monolith-crowned citadel whereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters. When I think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there I almost wish to kill myself forthwith. Johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping Babylon of elder daemons, and must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet. Awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks, at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith, and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and bas-reliefs with the queer image found in the shrine on the Alert, is poignantly visible in every line of the mates frightened description. Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city; for instead of describing any de?nite structure or building, he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfacessurfaces too great to belong to any thing right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs. I mention his talk about angles because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful dreams. He said that the geometry of the dream-place he saw was abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours. Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality. Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud-bank on this monstrous Acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase. The very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarising miasma welling out from this sea-soaked perversion, and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second glance shewed concavity after the ?rst shewed convexity. Something very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more de?nite than rock and ooze and weed was seen. Each would have ?ed had he not feared the scorn of the others, and it was only half-heartedly that they searchedvainly, as it provedfor some portable souvenir to bear away. It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what he had found. The rest followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved door with the now familiar squid-dragon bas-relief. It was, Johansen said, like a great barn-door; and they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel, threshold, and jambs around it, though they could not decide whether it lay ?at like a trap-door or slantwise like an outside cellar-door. As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong. One could not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal, hence the relative position of everything else seemed phan
22
tasmally variable. Briden pushed at the stone in several places without result. Then Donovan felt over it delicately around the edge, pressing each point separately as he went. He climbed interminably along the grotesque stone mouldingthat is, one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontaland the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast. Then, very softly and slowly, the acre-great panel began to give inward at the top; and they saw that it was balanced. Donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and rejoined his fellows, and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven portal. In this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way, so that all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset. The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on ?apping membraneous wings. The odour rising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness. Poor Johansens handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this. Of the six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant. The Thing cannot be describedthere is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own. The stars were right again, and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident. After vigintillions of years great Cthulhu was loose again, and ravening for delight. Three men were swept up by the ?abby claws before anybody turned. God rest them, if there be any rest in the universe. They were Donovan, Guerrera, and Angstrom. Parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green-crusted rock to the boat, and Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldnt have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse. So only Briden and Johansen reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous monstrosity ?opped down the slimy stones and hesitated ?oundering at the edge of the water.
23
Steam had not been su?ered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between wheel and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme cursing the ?eeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes of cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously. But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely overtake the Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the engine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern of a daemon galleon. The awful squidhead with writhing feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on relentlessly. There was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sun?sh, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and a sound that the chronicler could not put on paper. For an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seething astern; whereGod in heaven!the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened every second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam. That was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side. He did not try to navigate after the ?rst bold ?ight, for the reaction had taken something out of his soul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness. There is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of in?nity, of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comets tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus. Out of that dream came rescuethe Vigilant, the vice-admiralty court, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg. He could not tellthey would think him mad. He would write of what he knew before death came, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories. That was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside the bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go
24
this record of minethis test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together again. I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the ?owers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still lives. Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise. Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men. A time will comebut I must not and cannot think! Let me pray that, if I do not survive this manuscript, my executors may put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye.

CRITIAS by Plato
Translated by Benjamin Jowett
INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS. The Critias is a fragment which breaks off in the middle of a sentence.  It was designed to be the second part of a trilogy, which, like the other great Platonic trilogy of the Sophist, Statesman, Philosopher, was never
completed.  Timaeus had brought down the origin of the world to the creation of man, and the dawn of history was now to succeed the philosophy of nature.  The Critias is also connected with the Republic.  Plato, as he has already told us (Tim.), intended to represent the ideal state engaged in a patriotic conflict.  This mythical conflict is prophetic or symbolical of the struggle of Athens and Persia, perhaps in some degree also of the wars of the Greeks and Carthaginians, in the same way that the Persian is prefigured by the Trojan war to the mind of Herodotus, or as the narrative of the first part of the Aeneid is intended by Virgil to foreshadow the wars of Carthage and Rome.  The small number of the primitive Athenian citizens (20,000), 'which is about their present number' (Crit.), is evidently designed to contrast with the myriads and barbaric array of the Atlantic hosts.  The passing remark in the Timaeus that Athens was left alone in the struggle, in which she conquered and became the liberator of Greece, is also an allusion to the later history.  Hence we may safely conclude that the entire narrative is due to the imagination of Plato, who has used the name of Solon and introduced the Egyptian priests to give verisimilitude to his story.  To the Greek such a tale, like that of the earth-born men, would have seemed perfectly accordant with the character of his mythology, and not more marvellous than the wonders of the East narrated by Herodotus and others:  he might have been deceived into believing it.  But it appears strange that later ages should have been imposed upon by the fiction.  As many attempts have been made to find the great island of Atlantis, as to discover the country of the lost tribes. Without regard to the description of Plato, and without a suspicion that the whole narrative is a fabrication, interpreters have looked for the spot in every part of the globe, America, Arabia Felix, Ceylon, Palestine, Sardinia, Sweden. Timaeus concludes with a prayer that his words may be acceptable to the God whom he has revealed, and Critias, whose turn follows, begs that a larger measure of indulgence may be conceded to him, because he has to speak of men whom we know and not of gods whom we do not know.  Socrates readily grants his request, and anticipating that Hermocrates will make a similar petition, extends by anticipation a like indulgence to him. Critias returns to his story, professing only to repeat what Solon was told by the priests.  The war of which he was about to speak had occurred 9000 years ago.  One of the combatants was the city of Athens, the other was the great island of Atlantis.  Critias proposes to speak of these rival powers first of all, giving to Athens the precedence; the various tribes of Greeks and barbarians who took part in the war will be dealt with as they successively appear on the scene. In the beginning the gods agreed to divide the earth by lot in a friendly manner, and when they had made the allotment they settled their several countries, and were the shepherds or rather the pilots of mankind, whom they guided by persuasion, and not by force.  Hephaestus and Athena, brother and sister deities, in mind and art united, obtained as their lot the land of Attica, a land suited to the growth of virtue and wisdom; and there they settled a brave race of children of the soil, and taught them how to order the state.  Some of their names, such as Cecrops, Erechtheus, Erichthonius, and Erysichthon, were preserved and adopted in later times, but the memory of their deeds has passed away; for there have since been many deluges, and the remnant who survived in the mountains were ignorant of the art of writing, and during many generations were wholly devoted to acquiring the means of life...And the armed image of the goddess which was
dedicated by the ancient Athenians is an evidence to other ages that men and women had in those days, as they ought always to have, common virtues and pursuits.  There were various classes of citizens, including handicraftsmen and husbandmen and a superior class of warriors who dwelt apart, and were educated, and had all things in common, like our guardians. Attica in those days extended southwards to the Isthmus, and inland to the heights of Parnes and Cithaeron, and between them and the sea included the district of Oropus.  The country was then, as what remains of it still is, the most fertile in the world, and abounded in rich plains and pastures. But in the course of ages much of the soil was washed away and disappeared in the deep sea.  And the inhabitants of this fair land were endowed with intelligence and the love of beauty. The Acropolis of the ancient Athens extended to the Ilissus and Eridanus, and included the Pnyx, and the Lycabettus on the opposite side to the Pnyx, having a level surface and deep soil.  The side of the hill was inhabited by craftsmen and husbandmen; and the warriors dwelt by themselves on the summit, around the temples of Hephaestus and Athene, in an enclosure which was like the garden of a single house.  In winter they retired into houses on the north of the hill, in which they held their syssitia.  These were modest dwellings, which they bequeathed unaltered to their children's children.  In summer time the south side was inhabited by them, and then they left their gardens and dining-halls.  In the midst of the Acropolis was a fountain, which gave an abundant supply of cool water in summer and warm in winter; of this there are still some traces.  They were careful to preserve the number of fighting men and women at 20,000, which is equal to that of the present military force.  And so they passed their lives as guardians of the citizens and leaders of the Hellenes.  They were a just and famous race, celebrated for their beauty and virtue all over Europe and Asia. And now I will speak to you of their adversaries, but first I ought to explain that the Greek names were given to Solon in an Egyptian form, and he enquired their meaning and translated them.  His manuscript was left with my grandfather Dropides, and is now in my possession...In the division of the earth Poseidon obtained as his portion the island of Atlantis, and there he begat children whose mother was a mortal.  Towards the sea and in the centre of the island there was a very fair and fertile plain, and near the centre, about fifty stadia from the plain, there was a low mountain in which dwelt a man named Evenor and his wife Leucippe, and their daughter Cleito, of whom Poseidon became enamoured.  He to secure his love enclosed the mountain with rings or zones varying in size, two of land and three of sea, which his divine power readily enabled him to excavate and fashion, and, as there was no shipping in those days, no man could get into the place.  To the interior island he conveyed under the earth springs of water hot and cold, and supplied the land with all things needed for the life of man.  Here he begat a family consisting of five pairs of twin male children.  The eldest was Atlas, and him he made king of the centre island, while to his twin brother, Eumelus, or Gadeirus, he assigned that part of the country which was nearest the Straits.  The other brothers he made chiefs over the rest of the island.  And their kingdom extended as far as Egypt and Tyrrhenia.  Now Atlas had a fair posterity, and great treasures derived from mines--among them that precious metal orichalcum; and there was abundance of wood, and herds of elephants, and pastures for animals of all kinds, and fragrant herbs, and grasses, and trees bearing fruit.  These they used, and employed themselves in constructing their temples, and palaces, and harbours, and docks, in the following manner:--First, they
bridged over the zones of sea, and made a way to and from the royal palace which they built in the centre island.  This ancient palace was ornamented by successive generations; and they dug a canal which passed through the zones of land from the island to the sea.  The zones of earth were surrounded by walls made of stone of divers colours, black and white and red, which they sometimes intermingled for the sake of ornament; and as they quarried they hollowed out beneath the edges of the zones double docks having roofs of rock.  The outermost of the walls was coated with brass, the second with tin, and the third, which was the wall of the citadel, flashed with the red light of orichalcum.  In the interior of the citadel was a holy temple, dedicated to Cleito and Poseidon, and surrounded by an enclosure of gold, and there was Poseidon's own temple, which was covered with silver, and the pinnacles with gold.  The roof was of ivory, adorned with gold and silver and orichalcum, and the rest of the interior was lined with orichalcum.  Within was an image of the god standing in a chariot drawn by six winged horses, and touching the roof with his head; around him were a hundred Nereids, riding on dolphins.  Outside the temple were placed golden statues of all the descendants of the ten kings and of their wives; there was an altar too, and there were palaces, corresponding to the greatness and glory both of the kingdom and of the temple. Also there were fountains of hot and cold water, and suitable buildings surrounding them, and trees, and there were baths both of the kings and of private individuals, and separate baths for women, and also for cattle. The water from the baths was carried to the grove of Poseidon, and by aqueducts over the bridges to the outer circles.  And there were temples in the zones, and in the larger of the two there was a racecourse for horses, which ran all round the island.  The guards were distributed in the zones according to the trust reposed in them; the most trusted of them were stationed in the citadel.  The docks were full of triremes and stores. The land between the harbour and the sea was surrounded by a wall, and was crowded with dwellings, and the harbour and canal resounded with the din of human voices. The plain around the city was highly cultivated and sheltered from the north by mountains; it was oblong, and where falling out of the straight line followed the circular ditch, which was of an incredible depth.  This depth received the streams which came down from the mountains, as well as the canals of the interior, and found a way to the sea.  The entire country was divided into sixty thousand lots, each of which was a square of ten stadia; and the owner of a lot was bound to furnish the sixth part of a war-chariot, so as to make up ten thousand chariots, two horses and riders upon them, a pair of chariot-horses without a seat, and an attendant and charioteer, two hoplites, two archers, two slingers, three stone-shooters, three javelin-men, and four sailors to make up the complement of twelve hundred ships. Each of the ten kings was absolute in his own city and kingdom.  The relations of the different governments to one another were determined by the injunctions of Poseidon, which had been inscribed by the first kings on a column of orichalcum in the temple of Poseidon, at which the kings and princes gathered together and held a festival every fifth and every sixth year alternately.  Around the temple ranged the bulls of Poseidon, one of which the ten kings caught and sacrificed, shedding the blood of the victim over the inscription, and vowing not to transgress the laws of their father Poseidon.  When night came, they put on azure robes and gave judgment against offenders.  The most important of their laws related to their
dealings with one another.  They were not to take up arms against one another, and were to come to the rescue if any of their brethren were attacked.  They were to deliberate in common about war, and the king was not to have the power of life and death over his kinsmen, unless he had the assent of the majority. For many generations, as tradition tells, the people of Atlantis were obedient to the laws and to the gods, and practised gentleness and wisdom in their intercourse with one another.  They knew that they could only have the true use of riches by not caring about them.  But gradually the divine portion of their souls became diluted with too much of the mortal admixture, and they began to degenerate, though to the outward eye they appeared glorious as ever at the very time when they were filled with all iniquity.  The all-seeing Zeus, wanting to punish them, held a council of the gods, and when he had called them together, he spoke as follows:-No one knew better than Plato how to invent 'a noble lie.'  Observe (1) the innocent declaration of Socrates, that the truth of the story is a great advantage:  (2) the manner in which traditional names and indications of geography are intermingled ('Why, here be truths!'):  (3) the extreme minuteness with which the numbers are given, as in the Old Epic poetry: (4) the ingenious reason assigned for the Greek names occurring in the Egyptian tale:  (5) the remark that the armed statue of Athena indicated the common warrior life of men and women:  (6) the particularity with which the third deluge before that of Deucalion is affirmed to have been the great destruction:  (7) the happy guess that great geological changes have been effected by water:  (8) the indulgence of the prejudice against sailing beyond the Columns, and the popular belief of the shallowness of the ocean in that part:  (9) the confession that the depth of the ditch in the Island of Atlantis was not to be believed, and 'yet he could only repeat what he had heard', compared with the statement made in an earlier passage that Poseidon, being a God, found no difficulty in contriving the water-supply of the centre island:  (10) the mention of the old rivalry of Poseidon and Athene, and the creation of the first inhabitants out of the soil.  Plato here, as elsewhere, ingeniously gives the impression that he is telling the truth which mythology had corrupted. The world, like a child, has readily, and for the most part unhesitatingly, accepted the tale of the Island of Atlantis.  In modern times we hardly seek for traces of the submerged continent; but even Mr. Grote is inclined to believe in the Egyptian poem of Solon of which there is no evidence in antiquity; while others, like Martin, discuss the Egyptian origin of the legend, or like M. de Humboldt, whom he quotes, are disposed to find in it a vestige of a widely-spread tradition.  Others, adopting a different vein of reflection, regard the Island of Atlantis as the anticipation of a still greater island--the Continent of America.  'The tale,' says M. Martin, 'rests upon the authority of the Egyptian priests; and the Egyptian priests took a pleasure in deceiving the Greeks.'  He never appears to suspect that there is a greater deceiver or magician than the Egyptian priests, that is to say, Plato himself, from the dominion of whose genius the critic and natural philosopher of modern times are not wholly emancipated.  Although worthless in respect of any result which can be attained by them, discussions like those of M. Martin (Timee) have an interest of their own, and may be compared to the similar discussions regarding the Lost Tribes (2 Esdras), as showing how the chance word of some poet or philosopher has given birth to endless religious or historical enquiries.  (See Introduction to the Timaeus.)
In contrasting the small Greek city numbering about twenty thousand inhabitants with the barbaric greatness of the island of Atlantis, Plato probably intended to show that a state, such as the ideal Athens, was invincible, though matched against any number of opponents (cp. Rep.). Even in a great empire there might be a degree of virtue and justice, such as the Greeks believed to have existed under the sway of the first Persian kings.  But all such empires were liable to degenerate, and soon incurred the anger of the gods.  Their Oriental wealth, and splendour of gold and silver, and variety of colours, seemed also to be at variance with the simplicity of Greek notions.  In the island of Atlantis, Plato is describing a sort of Babylonian or Egyptian city, to which he opposes the frugal life of the true Hellenic citizen.  It is remarkable that in his brief sketch of them, he idealizes the husbandmen 'who are lovers of honour and true husbandmen,' as well as the warriors who are his sole concern in the Republic; and that though he speaks of the common pursuits of men and women, he says nothing of the community of wives and children. It is singular that Plato should have prefixed the most detested of Athenian names to this dialogue, and even more singular that he should have put into the mouth of Socrates a panegyric on him (Tim.).  Yet we know that his character was accounted infamous by Xenophon, and that the mere acquaintance with him was made a subject of accusation against Socrates. We can only infer that in this, and perhaps in some other cases, Plato's characters have no reference to the actual facts.  The desire to do honour to his own family, and the connection with Solon, may have suggested the introduction of his name.  Why the Critias was never completed, whether from accident, or from advancing age, or from a sense of the artistic difficulty of the design, cannot be determined.
CRITIAS.
PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Critias, Hermocrates, Timaeus, Socrates.
TIMAEUS:  How thankful I am, Socrates, that I have arrived at last, and, like a weary traveller after a long journey, may be at rest!  And I pray the being who always was of old, and has now been by me revealed, to grant that my words may endure in so far as they have been spoken truly and acceptably to him; but if unintentionally I have said anything wrong, I pray that he will impose upon me a just retribution, and the just retribution of him who errs is that he should be set right.  Wishing, then, to speak truly in future concerning the generation of the gods, I pray him to give me knowledge, which of all medicines is the most perfect and best. And now having offered my prayer I deliver up the argument to Critias, who is to speak next according to our agreement.  (Tim.) CRITIAS:  And I, Timaeus, accept the trust, and as you at first said that you were going to speak of high matters, and begged that some forbearance might be shown to you, I too ask the same or greater forbearance for what I am about to say.  And although I very well know that my request may appear to be somewhat ambitious and discourteous, I must make it nevertheless. For will any man of sense deny that you have spoken well?  I can only attempt to show that I ought to have more indulgence than you, because my
theme is more difficult; and I shall argue that to seem to speak well of the gods to men is far easier than to speak well of men to men:  for the inexperience and utter ignorance of his hearers about any subject is a great assistance to him who has to speak of it, and we know how ignorant we are concerning the gods.  But I should like to make my meaning clearer, if you will follow me.  All that is said by any of us can only be imitation and representation.  For if we consider the likenesses which painters make of bodies divine and heavenly, and the different degrees of gratification with which the eye of the spectator receives them, we shall see that we are satisfied with the artist who is able in any degree to imitate the earth and its mountains, and the rivers, and the woods, and the universe, and the things that are and move therein, and further, that knowing nothing precise about such matters, we do not examine or analyze the painting; all that is required is a sort of indistinct and deceptive mode of shadowing them forth.  But when a person endeavours to paint the human form we are quick at finding out defects, and our familiar knowledge makes us severe judges of any one who does not render every point of similarity.  And we may observe the same thing to happen in discourse; we are satisfied with a picture of divine and heavenly things which has very little likeness to them; but we are more precise in our criticism of mortal and human things. Wherefore if at the moment of speaking I cannot suitably express my meaning, you must excuse me, considering that to form approved likenesses of human things is the reverse of easy.  This is what I want to suggest to you, and at the same time to beg, Socrates, that I may have not less, but more indulgence conceded to me in what I am about to say.  Which favour, if I am right in asking, I hope that you will be ready to grant. SOCRATES:  Certainly, Critias, we will grant your request, and we will grant the same by anticipation to Hermocrates, as well as to you and Timaeus; for I have no doubt that when his turn comes a little while hence, he will make the same request which you have made.  In order, then, that he may provide himself with a fresh beginning, and not be compelled to say the same things over again, let him understand that the indulgence is already extended by anticipation to him.  And now, friend Critias, I will announce to you the judgment of the theatre.  They are of opinion that the last performer was wonderfully successful, and that you will need a great deal of indulgence before you will be able to take his place. HERMOCRATES:  The warning, Socrates, which you have addressed to him, I must also take to myself.  But remember, Critias, that faint heart never yet raised a trophy; and therefore you must go and attack the argument like a man.  First invoke Apollo and the Muses, and then let us hear you sound the praises and show forth the virtues of your ancient citizens. CRITIAS:  Friend Hermocrates, you, who are stationed last and have another in front of you, have not lost heart as yet; the gravity of the situation will soon be revealed to you; meanwhile I accept your exhortations and encouragements.  But besides the gods and goddesses whom you have mentioned, I would specially invoke Mnemosyne; for all the important part of my discourse is dependent on her favour, and if I can recollect and recite enough of what was said by the priests and brought hither by Solon, I doubt not that I shall satisfy the requirements of this theatre.  And now, making no more excuses, I will proceed. Let me begin by observing first of all, that nine thousand was the sum of years which had elapsed since the war which was said to have taken place between those who dwelt outside the pillars of Heracles and all who dwelt
within them; this war I am going to describe.  Of the combatants on the one side, the city of Athens was reported to have been the leader and to have fought out the war; the combatants on the other side were commanded by the kings of Atlantis, which, as I was saying, was an island greater in extent than Libya and Asia, and when afterwards sunk by an earthquake, became an impassable barrier of mud to voyagers sailing from hence to any part of the ocean.  The progress of the history will unfold the various nations of barbarians and families of Hellenes which then existed, as they successively appear on the scene; but I must describe first of all the Athenians of that day, and their enemies who fought with them, and then the respective powers and governments of the two kingdoms.  Let us give the precedence to Athens. In the days of old, the gods had the whole earth distributed among them by allotment (Cp. Polit.)  There was no quarrelling; for you cannot rightly suppose that the gods did not know what was proper for each of them to have, or, knowing this, that they would seek to procure for themselves by contention that which more properly belonged to others.  They all of them by just apportionment obtained what they wanted, and peopled their own districts; and when they had peopled them they tended us, their nurselings and possessions, as shepherds tend their flocks, excepting only that they did not use blows or bodily force, as shepherds do, but governed us like pilots from the stern of the vessel, which is an easy way of guiding animals, holding our souls by the rudder of persuasion according to their own pleasure;--thus did they guide all mortal creatures.  Now different gods had their allotments in different places which they set in order. Hephaestus and Athene, who were brother and sister, and sprang from the same father, having a common nature, and being united also in the love of philosophy and art, both obtained as their common portion this land, which was naturally adapted for wisdom and virtue; and there they implanted brave children of the soil, and put into their minds the order of government; their names are preserved, but their actions have disappeared by reason of the destruction of those who received the tradition, and the lapse of ages. For when there were any survivors, as I have already said, they were men who dwelt in the mountains; and they were ignorant of the art of writing, and had heard only the names of the chiefs of the land, but very little about their actions.  The names they were willing enough to give to their children; but the virtues and the laws of their predecessors, they knew only by obscure traditions; and as they themselves and their children lacked for many generations the necessaries of life, they directed their attention to the supply of their wants, and of them they conversed, to the neglect of events that had happened in times long past; for mythology and the enquiry into antiquity are first introduced into cities when they begin to have leisure (Cp. Arist. Metaphys.), and when they see that the necessaries of life have already been provided, but not before.  And this is the reason why the names of the ancients have been preserved to us and not their actions.  This I infer because Solon said that the priests in their narrative of that war mentioned most of the names which are recorded prior to the time of Theseus, such as Cecrops, and Erechtheus, and Erichthonius, and Erysichthon, and the names of the women in like manner. Moreover, since military pursuits were then common to men and women, the men of those days in accordance with the custom of the time set up a figure and image of the goddess in full armour, to be a testimony that all animals which associate together, male as well as female, may, if they please, practise in common the virtue which belongs to them without distinction of sex.
Now the country was inhabited in those days by various classes of citizens;--there were artisans, and there were husbandmen, and there was also a warrior class originally set apart by divine men.  The latter dwelt by themselves, and had all things suitable for nurture and education; neither had any of them anything of their own, but they regarded all that they had as common property; nor did they claim to receive of the other citizens anything more than their necessary food.  And they practised all the pursuits which we yesterday described as those of our imaginary guardians.  Concerning the country the Egyptian priests said what is not only probable but manifestly true, that the boundaries were in those days fixed by the Isthmus, and that in the direction of the continent they extended as far as the heights of Cithaeron and Parnes; the boundary line came down in the direction of the sea, having the district of Oropus on the right, and with the river Asopus as the limit on the left.  The land was the best in the world, and was therefore able in those days to support a vast army, raised from the surrounding people.  Even the remnant of Attica which now exists may compare with any region in the world for the variety and excellence of its fruits and the suitableness of its pastures to every sort of animal, which proves what I am saying; but in those days the country was fair as now and yielded far more abundant produce.  How shall I establish my words? and what part of it can be truly called a remnant of the land that then was?  The whole country is only a long promontory extending far into the sea away from the rest of the continent, while the surrounding basin of the sea is everywhere deep in the neighbourhood of the shore.  Many great deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years, for that is the number of years which have elapsed since the time of which I am speaking; and during all this time and through so many changes, there has never been any considerable accumulation of the soil coming down from the mountains, as in other places, but the earth has fallen away all round and sunk out of sight.  The consequence is, that in comparison of what then was, there are remaining only the bones of the wasted body, as they may be called, as in the case of small islands, all the richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen away, and the mere skeleton of the land being left. But in the primitive state of the country, its mountains were high hills covered with soil, and the plains, as they are termed by us, of Phelleus were full of rich earth, and there was abundance of wood in the mountains. Of this last the traces still remain, for although some of the mountains now only afford sustenance to bees, not so very long ago there were still to be seen roofs of timber cut from trees growing there, which were of a size sufficient to cover the largest houses; and there were many other high trees, cultivated by man and bearing abundance of food for cattle. Moreover, the land reaped the benefit of the annual rainfall, not as now losing the water which flows off the bare earth into the sea, but, having an abundant supply in all places, and receiving it into herself and treasuring it up in the close clay soil, it let off into the hollows the streams which it absorbed from the heights, providing everywhere abundant fountains and rivers, of which there may still be observed sacred memorials in places where fountains once existed; and this proves the truth of what I am saying. Such was the natural state of the country, which was cultivated, as we may well believe, by true husbandmen, who made husbandry their business, and were lovers of honour, and of a noble nature, and had a soil the best in the world, and abundance of water, and in the heaven above an excellently attempered climate.  Now the city in those days was arranged on this wise. In the first place the Acropolis was not as now.  For the fact is that a single night of excessive rain washed away the earth and laid bare the
rock; at the same time there were earthquakes, and then occurred the extraordinary inundation, which was the third before the great destruction of Deucalion.  But in primitive times the hill of the Acropolis extended to the Eridanus and Ilissus, and included the Pnyx on one side, and the Lycabettus as a boundary on the opposite side to the Pnyx, and was all well covered with soil, and level at the top, except in one or two places. Outside the Acropolis and under the sides of the hill there dwelt artisans, and such of the husbandmen as were tilling the ground near; the warrior class dwelt by themselves around the temples of Athene and Hephaestus at the summit, which moreover they had enclosed with a single fence like the garden of a single house.  On the north side they had dwellings in common and had erected halls for dining in winter, and had all the buildings which they needed for their common life, besides temples, but there was no adorning of them with gold and silver, for they made no use of these for any purpose; they took a middle course between meanness and ostentation, and built modest houses in which they and their children's children grew old, and they handed them down to others who were like themselves, always the same.  But in summer-time they left their gardens and gymnasia and dining halls, and then the southern side of the hill was made use of by them for the same purpose.  Where the Acropolis now is there was a fountain, which was choked by the earthquake, and has left only the few small streams which still exist in the vicinity, but in those days the fountain gave an abundant supply of water for all and of suitable temperature in summer and in winter.  This is how they dwelt, being the guardians of their own citizens and the leaders of the Hellenes, who were their willing followers.  And they took care to preserve the same number of men and women through all time, being so many as were required for warlike purposes, then as now--that is to say, about twenty thousand.  Such were the ancient Athenians, and after this manner they righteously administered their own land and the rest of Hellas; they were renowned all over Europe and Asia for the beauty of their persons and for the many virtues of their souls, and of all men who lived in those days they were the most illustrious.  And next, if I have not forgotten what I heard when I was a child, I will impart to you the character and origin of their adversaries. For friends should not keep their stories to themselves, but have them in common. Yet, before proceeding further in the narrative, I ought to warn you, that you must not be surprised if you should perhaps hear Hellenic names given to foreigners.  I will tell you the reason of this:  Solon, who was intending to use the tale for his poem, enquired into the meaning of the names, and found that the early Egyptians in writing them down had translated them into their own language, and he recovered the meaning of the several names and when copying them out again translated them into our language.  My great-grandfather, Dropides, had the original writing, which is still in my possession, and was carefully studied by me when I was a child.  Therefore if you hear names such as are used in this country, you must not be surprised, for I have told how they came to be introduced.  The tale, which was of great length, began as follows:-I have before remarked in speaking of the allotments of the gods, that they distributed the whole earth into portions differing in extent, and made for themselves temples and instituted sacrifices.  And Poseidon, receiving for his lot the island of Atlantis, begat children by a mortal woman, and settled them in a part of the island, which I will describe.  Looking towards the sea, but in the centre of the whole island, there was a plain which is said to have been the fairest of all plains and very fertile. 
Near the plain again, and also in the centre of the island at a distance of about fifty stadia, there was a mountain not very high on any side.  In this mountain there dwelt one of the earth-born primeval men of that country, whose name was Evenor, and he had a wife named Leucippe, and they had an only daughter who was called Cleito.  The maiden had already reached womanhood, when her father and mother died; Poseidon fell in love with her and had intercourse with her, and breaking the ground, inclosed the hill in which she dwelt all round, making alternate zones of sea and land larger and smaller, encircling one another; there were two of land and three of water, which he turned as with a lathe, each having its circumference equidistant every way from the centre, so that no man could get to the island, for ships and voyages were not as yet.  He himself, being a god, found no difficulty in making special arrangements for the centre island, bringing up two springs of water from beneath the earth, one of warm water and the other of cold, and making every variety of food to spring up abundantly from the soil.  He also begat and brought up five pairs of twin male children; and dividing the island of Atlantis into ten portions, he gave to the first-born of the eldest pair his mother's dwelling and the surrounding allotment, which was the largest and best, and made him king over the rest; the others he made princes, and gave them rule over many men, and a large territory.  And he named them all; the eldest, who was the first king, he named Atlas, and after him the whole island and the ocean were called Atlantic.  To his twin brother, who was born after him, and obtained as his lot the extremity of the island towards the pillars of Heracles, facing the country which is now called the region of Gades in that part of the world, he gave the name which in the Hellenic language is Eumelus, in the language of the country which is named after him, Gadeirus. Of the second pair of twins he called one Ampheres, and the other Evaemon. To the elder of the third pair of twins he gave the name Mneseus, and Autochthon to the one who followed him.  Of the fourth pair of twins he called the elder Elasippus, and the younger Mestor.  And of the fifth pair he gave to the elder the name of Azaes, and to the younger that of Diaprepes.  All these and their descendants for many generations were the inhabitants and rulers of divers islands in the open sea; and also, as has been already said, they held sway in our direction over the country within the pillars as far as Egypt and Tyrrhenia.  Now Atlas had a numerous and honourable family, and they retained the kingdom, the eldest son handing it on to his eldest for many generations; and they had such an amount of wealth as was never before possessed by kings and potentates, and is not likely ever to be again, and they were furnished with everything which they needed, both in the city and country.  For because of the greatness of their empire many things were brought to them from foreign countries, and the island itself provided most of what was required by them for the uses of life.  In the first place, they dug out of the earth whatever was to be found there, solid as well as fusile, and that which is now only a name and was then something more than a name, orichalcum, was dug out of the earth in many parts of the island, being more precious in those days than anything except gold.  There was an abundance of wood for carpenter's work, and sufficient maintenance for tame and wild animals.  Moreover, there were a great number of elephants in the island; for as there was provision for all other sorts of animals, both for those which live in lakes and marshes and rivers, and also for those which live in mountains and on plains, so there was for the animal which is the largest and most voracious of all. Also whatever fragrant things there now are in the earth, whether roots, or herbage, or woods, or essences which distil from fruit and flower, grew and thrived in that land; also the fruit which admits of cultivation, both the dry sort, which is given us for nourishment and any other which we use for
food--we call them all by the common name of pulse, and the fruits having a hard rind, affording drinks and meats and ointments, and good store of chestnuts and the like, which furnish pleasure and amusement, and are fruits which spoil with keeping, and the pleasant kinds of dessert, with which we console ourselves after dinner, when we are tired of eating--all these that sacred island which then beheld the light of the sun, brought forth fair and wondrous and in infinite abundance.  With such blessings the earth freely furnished them; meanwhile they went on constructing their temples and palaces and harbours and docks.  And they arranged the whole country in the following manner:-First of all they bridged over the zones of sea which surrounded the ancient metropolis, making a road to and from the royal palace.  And at the very beginning they built the palace in the habitation of the god and of their ancestors, which they continued to ornament in successive generations, every king surpassing the one who went before him to the utmost of his power, until they made the building a marvel to behold for size and for beauty.  And beginning from the sea they bored a canal of three hundred feet in width and one hundred feet in depth and fifty stadia in length, which they carried through to the outermost zone, making a passage from the sea up to this, which became a harbour, and leaving an opening sufficient to enable the largest vessels to find ingress. Moreover, they divided at the bridges the zones of land which parted the zones of sea, leaving room for a single trireme to pass out of one zone into another, and they covered over the channels so as to leave a way underneath for the ships; for the banks were raised considerably above the water.  Now the largest of the zones into which a passage was cut from the sea was three stadia in breadth, and the zone of land which came next of equal breadth; but the next two zones, the one of water, the other of land, were two stadia, and the one which surrounded the central island was a stadium only in width.  The island in which the palace was situated had a diameter of five stadia.  All this including the zones and the bridge, which was the sixth part of a stadium in width, they surrounded by a stone wall on every side, placing towers and gates on the bridges where the sea passed in.  The stone which was used in the work they quarried from underneath the centre island, and from underneath the zones, on the outer as well as the inner side.  One kind was white, another black, and a third red, and as they quarried, they at the same time hollowed out double docks, having roofs formed out of the native rock.  Some of their buildings were simple, but in others they put together different stones, varying the colour to please the eye, and to be a natural source of delight.  The entire circuit of the wall, which went round the outermost zone, they covered with a coating of brass, and the circuit of the next wall they coated with tin, and the third, which encompassed the citadel, flashed with the red light of orichalcum.  The palaces in the interior of the citadel were constructed on this wise:--In the centre was a holy temple dedicated to Cleito and Poseidon, which remained inaccessible, and was surrounded by an enclosure of gold; this was the spot where the family of the ten princes first saw the light, and thither the people annually brought the fruits of the earth in their season from all the ten portions, to be an offering to each of the ten.  Here was Poseidon's own temple which was a stadium in length, and half a stadium in width, and of a proportionate height, having a strange barbaric appearance.  All the outside of the temple, with the exception of the pinnacles, they covered with silver, and the pinnacles with gold.  In the interior of the temple the roof was of ivory, curiously wrought everywhere with gold and silver and orichalcum; and all the other parts, the walls and pillars and floor, they coated with orichalcum.  In
the temple they placed statues of gold:  there was the god himself standing in a chariot--the charioteer of six winged horses--and of such a size that he touched the roof of the building with his head; around him there were a hundred Nereids riding on dolphins, for such was thought to be the number of them by the men of those days.  There were also in the interior of the temple other images which had been dedicated by private persons.  And around the temple on the outside were placed statues of gold of all the descendants of the ten kings and of their wives, and there were many other great offerings of kings and of private persons, coming both from the city itself and from the foreign cities over which they held sway.  There was an altar too, which in size and workmanship corresponded to this magnificence, and the palaces, in like manner, answered to the greatness of the kingdom and the glory of the temple. In the next place, they had fountains, one of cold and another of hot water, in gracious plenty flowing; and they were wonderfully adapted for use by reason of the pleasantness and excellence of their waters.  They constructed buildings about them and planted suitable trees, also they made cisterns, some open to the heaven, others roofed over, to be used in winter as warm baths; there were the kings' baths, and the baths of private persons, which were kept apart; and there were separate baths for women, and for horses and cattle, and to each of them they gave as much adornment as was suitable.  Of the water which ran off they carried some to the grove of Poseidon, where were growing all manner of trees of wonderful height and beauty, owing to the excellence of the soil, while the remainder was conveyed by aqueducts along the bridges to the outer circles; and there were many temples built and dedicated to many gods; also gardens and places of exercise, some for men, and others for horses in both of the two islands formed by the zones; and in the centre of the larger of the two there was set apart a race-course of a stadium in width, and in length allowed to extend all round the island, for horses to race in.  Also there were guardhouses at intervals for the guards, the more trusted of whom were appointed to keep watch in the lesser zone, which was nearer the Acropolis; while the most trusted of all had houses given them within the citadel, near the persons of the kings.  The docks were full of triremes and naval stores, and all things were quite ready for use.  Enough of the plan of the royal palace. Leaving the palace and passing out across the three harbours, you came to a wall which began at the sea and went all round:  this was everywhere distant fifty stadia from the largest zone or harbour, and enclosed the whole, the ends meeting at the mouth of the channel which led to the sea. The entire area was densely crowded with habitations; and the canal and the largest of the harbours were full of vessels and merchants coming from all parts, who, from their numbers, kept up a multitudinous sound of human voices, and din and clatter of all sorts night and day. I have described the city and the environs of the ancient palace nearly in the words of Solon, and now I must endeavour to represent to you the nature and arrangement of the rest of the land.  The whole country was said by him to be very lofty and precipitous on the side of the sea, but the country immediately about and surrounding the city was a level plain, itself surrounded by mountains which descended towards the sea; it was smooth and even, and of an oblong shape, extending in one direction three thousand stadia, but across the centre inland it was two thousand stadia.  This part of the island looked towards the south, and was sheltered from the north. The surrounding mountains were celebrated for their number and size and
beauty, far beyond any which still exist, having in them also many wealthy villages of country folk, and rivers, and lakes, and meadows supplying food enough for every animal, wild or tame, and much wood of various sorts, abundant for each and every kind of work. I will now describe the plain, as it was fashioned by nature and by the labours of many generations of kings through long ages.  It was for the most part rectangular and oblong, and where falling out of the straight line followed the circular ditch.  The depth, and width, and length of this ditch were incredible, and gave the impression that a work of such extent, in addition to so many others, could never have been artificial. Nevertheless I must say what I was told.  It was excavated to the depth of a hundred feet, and its breadth was a stadium everywhere; it was carried round the whole of the plain, and was ten thousand stadia in length.  It received the streams which came down from the mountains, and winding round the plain and meeting at the city, was there let off into the sea.  Further inland, likewise, straight canals of a hundred feet in width were cut from it through the plain, and again let off into the ditch leading to the sea: these canals were at intervals of a hundred stadia, and by them they brought down the wood from the mountains to the city, and conveyed the fruits of the earth in ships, cutting transverse passages from one canal into another, and to the city.  Twice in the year they gathered the fruits of the earth--in winter having the benefit of the rains of heaven, and in summer the water which the land supplied by introducing streams from the canals. As to the population, each of the lots in the plain had to find a leader for the men who were fit for military service, and the size of a lot was a square of ten stadia each way, and the total number of all the lots was sixty thousand.  And of the inhabitants of the mountains and of the rest of the country there was also a vast multitude, which was distributed among the lots and had leaders assigned to them according to their districts and villages.  The leader was required to furnish for the war the sixth portion of a war-chariot, so as to make up a total of ten thousand chariots; also two horses and riders for them, and a pair of chariot-horses without a seat, accompanied by a horseman who could fight on foot carrying a small shield, and having a charioteer who stood behind the man-at-arms to guide the two horses; also, he was bound to furnish two heavy-armed soldiers, two archers, two slingers, three stone-shooters and three javelin-men, who were light-armed, and four sailors to make up the complement of twelve hundred ships.  Such was the military order of the royal city--the order of the other nine governments varied, and it would be wearisome to recount their several differences. As to offices and honours, the following was the arrangement from the first.  Each of the ten kings in his own division and in his own city had the absolute control of the citizens, and, in most cases, of the laws, punishing and slaying whomsoever he would.  Now the order of precedence among them and their mutual relations were regulated by the commands of Poseidon which the law had handed down.  These were inscribed by the first kings on a pillar of orichalcum, which was situated in the middle of the island, at the temple of Poseidon, whither the kings were gathered together every fifth and every sixth year alternately, thus giving equal honour to the odd and to the even number.  And when they were gathered together they consulted about their common interests, and enquired if any one had transgressed in anything, and passed judgment, and before they passed judgment they gave their pledges to one another on this wise:--There were
bulls who had the range of the temple of Poseidon; and the ten kings, being left alone in the temple, after they had offered prayers to the god that they might capture the victim which was acceptable to him, hunted the bulls, without weapons, but with staves and nooses; and the bull which they caught they led up to the pillar and cut its throat over the top of it so that the blood fell upon the sacred inscription.  Now on the pillar, besides the laws, there was inscribed an oath invoking mighty curses on the disobedient.  When therefore, after slaying the bull in the accustomed manner, they had burnt its limbs, they filled a bowl of wine and cast in a clot of blood for each of them; the rest of the victim they put in the fire, after having purified the column all round.  Then they drew from the bowl in golden cups, and pouring a libation on the fire, they swore that they would judge according to the laws on the pillar, and would punish him who in any point had already transgressed them, and that for the future they would not, if they could help, offend against the writing on the pillar, and would neither command others, nor obey any ruler who commanded them, to act otherwise than according to the laws of their father Poseidon. This was the prayer which each of them offered up for himself and for his descendants, at the same time drinking and dedicating the cup out of which he drank in the temple of the god; and after they had supped and satisfied their needs, when darkness came on, and the fire about the sacrifice was cool, all of them put on most beautiful azure robes, and, sitting on the ground, at night, over the embers of the sacrifices by which they had sworn, and extinguishing all the fire about the temple, they received and gave judgment, if any of them had an accusation to bring against any one; and when they had given judgment, at daybreak they wrote down their sentences on a golden tablet, and dedicated it together with their robes to be a memorial. There were many special laws affecting the several kings inscribed about the temples, but the most important was the following:  They were not to take up arms against one another, and they were all to come to the rescue if any one in any of their cities attempted to overthrow the royal house; like their ancestors, they were to deliberate in common about war and other matters, giving the supremacy to the descendants of Atlas.  And the king was not to have the power of life and death over any of his kinsmen unless he had the assent of the majority of the ten. Such was the vast power which the god settled in the lost island of Atlantis; and this he afterwards directed against our land for the following reasons, as tradition tells:  For many generations, as long as the divine nature lasted in them, they were obedient to the laws, and well-affectioned towards the god, whose seed they were; for they possessed true and in every way great spirits, uniting gentleness with wisdom in the various chances of life, and in their intercourse with one another.  They despised everything but virtue, caring little for their present state of life, and thinking lightly of the possession of gold and other property, which seemed only a burden to them; neither were they intoxicated by luxury; nor did wealth deprive them of their self-control; but they were sober, and saw clearly that all these goods are increased by virtue and friendship with one another, whereas by too great regard and respect for them, they are lost and friendship with them.  By such reflections and by the continuance in them of a divine nature, the qualities which we have described grew and increased among them; but when the divine portion began to fade away, and became diluted too often and too much with the mortal admixture, and the human nature got the upper hand, they then, being unable to bear their fortune, behaved unseemly, and to him who had an eye to see
grew visibly debased, for they were losing the fairest of their precious gifts; but to those who had no eye to see the true happiness, they appeared glorious and blessed at the very time when they were full of avarice and unrighteous power.  Zeus, the god of gods, who rules according to law, and is able to see into such things, perceiving that an honourable race was in a woeful plight, and wanting to inflict punishment on them, that they might be chastened and improve, collected all the gods into their most holy habitation, which, being placed in the centre of the world, beholds all created things.  And when he had called them together, he spake as follows--* * The rest of the Dialogue of Critias has been lost.

Letter 1 To Mrs. Saville, England St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17 You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking. I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is forever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. Therefor with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, 
Frankenstein

we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this labourious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.

These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purposea point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my fathers dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life. These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted 
Frankenstein  
5 of 345 
with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent. Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services. And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every 
Frankenstein  
6 of 345 
enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing. This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel. I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend 
Frankenstein  
7 of 345 
to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never. Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness. Your affectionate brother, R. Walton Letter 2 To Mrs. Saville, England Archangel, 28th March, 17 How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage. But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil. I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by 
Frankenstein  
8 of 345 
disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathize with me, whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters 
Frankenstein  
9 of 345 
call it) *keeping*; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind. Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise. The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This circumstance, added to his wellknown integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, 
Frankenstein  
10 of 345 
has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prizemoney, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young womans father to consent to 
Frankenstein  
11 of 345 
her marriage with her lover. But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations. What a noble fellow! you will exclaim. He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command. Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care. I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is impossible to 
Frankenstein  
12 of 345 
communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to the land of mist and snow, but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the Ancient Mariner. You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically industrious painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labourbut besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore. But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on 
Frankenstein  
13 of 345 
some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again. Your affectionate brother, Robert Walton Letter 3 To Mrs. Saville, England July 7th, 17 My dear Sister, I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe and well advanced on my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected. 
Frankenstein  
14 of 345 
No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage. Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool, persevering, and prudent. But success *shall* crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man? My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must finish. Heaven bless my beloved sister! R.W.  Letter 4 To Mrs. Saville, England August 5th, 17 So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession. 
Frankenstein

Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather. About two oclock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice. This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, 
Frankenstein  
16 of 345 
by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention. About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to rest for a few hours. In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the master said, Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea. On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent. Before I come on board your vessel, said he, will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound? 
Frankenstein  
17 of 345 
You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole. Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board. Good God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully. Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived 
Frankenstein  
18 of 345 
him of understanding. When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him. When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose. Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle. His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, To seek one who fled from me. And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion? 
Frankenstein  
19 of 345 
Yes. Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice. This aroused the strangers attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the demon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries. Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman of me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine. And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life. Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge. From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which 
Frankenstein  
20 of 345 
had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight. Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable. I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart. I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record. August 13th, 17 
Frankenstein  
21 of 345 
My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence. He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul, and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One mans life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the 
Frankenstein  
22 of 345 
knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listeners countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips! Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure. Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my 
Frankenstein  
23 of 345 
lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing. I agree with you, replied the stranger; we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves such a friend ought to be do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But II have lost everything and cannot begin life anew. As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin. Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures. 
Frankenstein  
24 of 345 
Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music. August 19, 17 Yesterday the stranger said to me, You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I 
Frankenstein  
25 of 345 
reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed. You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer. I thank you, he replied, for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your 
Frankenstein  
26 of 345 
feeling, continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined. He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him and who hear it from his own lipswith what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked itthus!

Chapter 1 
I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family. As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in 
Frankenstein  
28 of 345 
wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance. Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchants house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.

His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life. Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beauforts coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife. There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a sense of justice in my fathers upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love 
Frankenstein  
30 of 345 
strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame. From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant 
Frankenstein  
31 of 345 
accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mothers tender caresses and my fathers smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something bettertheir child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me. For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages 
Frankenstein  
32 of 345 
of the poor. This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passionremembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relievedfor her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were darkeyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features. 
Frankenstein  
33 of 345 
The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italyone among the *schiavi ognor frementi*, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles. When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They 
Frankenstein  
34 of 345 
were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents house my more than sister the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures. Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, I have a pretty present for my Victor tomorrow he shall have it. And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as minemine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to memy more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.

Chapter 2 
We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss homethe sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summersshe found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as 
Frankenstein  
36 of 345 
they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember. On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels. 
Frankenstein

No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love. My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world. Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among 
Frankenstein  
38 of 345 
those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clervalcould aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition. I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterward ruled my destiny I find it 
Frankenstein  
39 of 345 
arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys. Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash. If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were 
Frankenstein  
40 of 345 
chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity. When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boys apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit. 
Frankenstein  
41 of 345 
The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomize, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined. But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a childs blindness, added to a students thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosophers stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory 
Frankenstein  
42 of 345 
would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death! Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfillment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas. When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and 
Frankenstein  
43 of 345 
nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed. Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge. In this mood of 
Frankenstein  
44 of 345 
mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration. Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my lifethe last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard. It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.

Chapter 3 
When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurredan omen, as it were, of my future misery. Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemperElizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her 
Frankenstein  
46 of 345 
medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. My children, she said, my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world. She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed foreverthat the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the 
Frankenstein  
47 of 345 
first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized. My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled. She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her 
Frankenstein  
48 of 345 
uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget. The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce. We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word Farewell! It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at mornings dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all theremy father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend. 
Frankenstein  
49 of 345 
I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasureI was now alone. In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were old familiar faces, but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent. I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased. 
Frankenstein

The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors. Chanceor rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my fathers doorled me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied. The professor stared. Have you, he said, really spent your time in studying such nonsense? I replied in the affirmative. Every minute, continued M. Krempe with warmth, every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a 
Frankenstein  
51 of 345 
disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew. So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted. I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape. M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time 
Frankenstein  
52 of 345 
and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth. Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town. Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect 
Frankenstein  
53 of 345 
expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard. He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget: The ancient teachers of this science, said he, promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders 
Frankenstein  
54 of 345 
of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows. Such were the professors wordsrather let me say such the words of the fateenounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankensteinmore, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation. I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the mornings dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternights thoughts were as a dream. There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a 
Frankenstein  
55 of 345 
certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor. He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited. He said that These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind. I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours. I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure. 
Frankenstein  
56 of 345 
I am happy, said M. Waldman, to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics. He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave. Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.

Chapter 4 
From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory. 
Frankenstein  
58 of 345 
As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid. My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of 
Frankenstein  
59 of 345 
the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay. One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have 
Frankenstein  
60 of 345 
trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon mea light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret. Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more certainly shine in the 
Frankenstein  
61 of 345 
heavens than that which I now affirm is true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter. The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light. 
Frankenstein  
62 of 345 
I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow. When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complete and wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command 
Frankenstein  
63 of 345 
hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began. No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the 
Frankenstein  
64 of 345 
gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption. These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the 
Frankenstein  
65 of 345 
unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion. The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with 
Frankenstein  
66 of 345 
affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected. I knew well therefore what would be my fathers feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed. I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no 
Frankenstein  
67 of 345 
man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed. But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed. My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my science by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leavessights which before always yielded me supreme delightso deeply was I engrossed in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck 
Frankenstein  
68 of 345 
I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete. 
Frankenstein

Chapter 5 
It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips. 
Frankenstein

The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the graveworms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; 
Frankenstein  
71 of 345 
when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life. Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived. I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every 
Frankenstein  
72 of 345 
artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete! Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky. I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: 
Frankenstein  
73 of 345 
Like one who, on a lonely road, Doth walk in fear and dread, And, having once turned round, walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread. [Coleridges Ancient Mariner.] Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out. My dear Frankenstein, exclaimed he, how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting! Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy. I 
Frankenstein  
74 of 345 
welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. You may easily believe, said he, how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of bookkeeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in *The Vicar of Wakefield*: I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek. But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge. It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth. Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein, continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights. 
Frankenstein  
75 of 345 
You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free. I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that 
Frankenstein  
76 of 345 
my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval. We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him. My dear Victor, cried he, what, for Gods sake, is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this? Do not ask me, cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; *he* can tell. Oh, save me! Save me! I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit. Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was not the witness of his grief, 
Frankenstein  
77 of 345 
for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time. This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards learned that, knowing my fathers advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them. But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was forever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event. 
Frankenstein  
78 of 345 
By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion. Dearest Clerval, exclaimed I, how kind, how very good you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me. You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not? I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think? 
Frankenstein  
79 of 345 
Compose yourself, said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence. Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love? If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I believe. 
Frankenstein  
80 of 345 
Chapter 6 
Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my own Elizabeth: My dearest Cousin, You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are forbidden to writeto hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting. 
Frankenstein

Get welland return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly. Your fathers health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother return to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected. Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountainsthey never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our 
Frankenstein  
82 of 345 
little household. Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore, in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being. Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate 
Frankenstein  
83 of 345 
it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelicashe looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions; I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress. Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her. When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her. One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a

Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mothers house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has returned to us, and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expressions continually remind me of my dear aunt. I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he smiles, two little 
Frankenstein  
85 of 345 
dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little *wives*, but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age. Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a very lively, pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much older than Manoir, but she is very much admired and a favourite with everybody. I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victorone lineone word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful. Adieu! My cousin, take care of yourself, and, I entreat you, write! Elizabeth Lavenza

Geneva, March 18th, 17 Dear, dear Elizabeth! I exclaimed when I had read her letter. I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel. I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber. One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment, for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the 
Frankenstein  
87 of 345 
subject, but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty and changed the subject from my improvement to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so often present to my recollection but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply. M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh, blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. 
Frankenstein  
88 of 345 
Waldman. Dn the fellow! cried he. Why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstripped us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the Gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance. Ay, ay, continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, M. Frankenstein is modest, an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval; I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time. M. Krempe had now commenced a eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me. Clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science, and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the Oriental languages, as thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes towards the East as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his 
Frankenstein  
89 of 345 
attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the Orientalists. I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses, in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome! Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly, for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends. My return had only been delayed so 
Frankenstein  
90 of 345 
long from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully, and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness. The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the rambles of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country. We passed a fortnight in these perambulations; my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow creatures and rendered me unsocial, but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature and the cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! How sincerely did you love me and endeavour to elevate my 
Frankenstein  
91 of 345 
mind until it was on a level with your own! A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden. Henry rejoiced in my gaiety and sincerely sympathized in my feelings; he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing; his conversation was full of imagination, and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity. We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon; the peasants were dancing, and everyone we met appeared gay 
Frankenstein  
92 of 345 
and happy. My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.

Chapter 7 
On my return, I found the following letter from my father: My dear Victor, You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings. William is dead!that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered! I will not attempt to console 
Frankenstein  
94 of 345 
you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction. Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return. This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched 
Frankenstein  
95 of 345 
on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murderers finger was on his neck. He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her; but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, O God! I have murdered my darling child! She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murdered to the deed. We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William! Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not 
Frankenstein  
96 of 345 
live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling! Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies. Your affectionate and afflicted father, Alphonse Frankenstein. Geneva, May 12th, 17. Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first expressed on receiving new from my friends. I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands. My dear Frankenstein, exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness, are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has happened? I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune. 
Frankenstein  
97 of 345 
I can offer you no consolation, my friend, said he; your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do? To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses. During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. Poor William! said he, dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderers grasp! How much more a murderer that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors. Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend. My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my 
Frankenstein  
98 of 345 
loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them. I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, the palaces of nature, were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva. The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child. Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome 
Frankenstein  
99 of 345 
your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness? I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake! Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure. It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot 
Frankenstein  
100 of 345 
where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased. I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copet. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Mole, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake. 
Frankenstein  
101 of 345 
While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this thy dirge! As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy daemon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child. He was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular 
Frankenstein  
102 of 345 
ascent of Mont Saleve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared. I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I resolved in my minds the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother? No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me. 
Frankenstein  
103 of 345 
Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open, and I hastened to my fathers house. My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Saleve? These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent. It was about five in the morning when I entered my fathers house. I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising. 
Frankenstein  
104 of 345 
Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my fathers desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: Welcome, my dearest Victor, said he. Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.Poor William! he was our darling and our pride! 
Frankenstein  
105 of 345 
Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brothers eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and her I named my cousin. She most of all, said Ernest, requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night! I do not know what you mean, replied my brother, in accents of wonder, but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime? 
Frankenstein  
106 of 345 
Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest? No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried to-day, and you will then hear all. He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner. This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, 
Frankenstein  
107 of 345 
You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent. At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William. We do also, unfortunately, replied my father, for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly. My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent. If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted. This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, 
Frankenstein  
108 of 345 
except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world? We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect. She welcomed me with the greatest affection. Your arrival, my dear cousin, said she, fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William. She is innocent, my Elizabeth, said I, and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal. 
Frankenstein  
109 of 345 
How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing. She wept. Dearest niece, said my father, dry your tears. If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.

Chapter 8 
We passed a few sad hours until eleven oclock, when the trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me. The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely 
Frankenstein  
111 of 345 
beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness. The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only 
Frankenstein  
112 of 345 
returned a confused and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight oclock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court. Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice. God knows, she said, how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious. 
Frankenstein  
113 of 345 
She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Chene, a village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her return, at about nine oclock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give no account. I know, continued the unhappy victim, how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have 
Frankenstein  
114 of 345 
expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon? I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence. Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court. I am, said she, the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by 
Frankenstein  
115 of 345 
and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncles house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her. 
Frankenstein  
116 of 345 
A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeths simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the demon who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold. I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned. 
Frankenstein  
117 of 345 
I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt. That evidence, he observed, was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive. This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result. My cousin, replied I, it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape. But she has confessed. This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justines innocence. Alas! said she. How shall I ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray? 
Frankenstein  
118 of 345 
Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder. Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide. Yes, said Elizabeth, I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone. The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse. We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She rose on seeing us enter; and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also. Oh, Justine! said she. Why did you rob me of my last consolation? I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now. And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer? Her voice was suffocated with sobs. 
Frankenstein  
119 of 345 
Rise, my poor girl, said Elizabeth; why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession. I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable. She paused, weeping, and then continued, I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. 
Frankenstein  
120 of 345 
Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all he happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death. Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die! You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune. Justine shook her head mournfully. I do not fear to die, she said; that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to the will of heaven! During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground 
Frankenstein  
121 of 345 
them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it was, she approached me and said, Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty? I could not answer. No, Justine, said Elizabeth; he is more convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it. I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin. Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with Justine, 
Frankenstein  
122 of 345 
and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away. I wish, cried she, that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery. Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so. And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeths heartrending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She perished on the scaffold as a murderess! From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my fathers woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of 
Frankenstein  
123 of 345 
my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments! Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts. 
Frankenstein

Chapter 9 
Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with selfsatisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe. 
Frankenstein  
125 of 345 
This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolationdeep, dark, deathlike solitude. My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me. Do you think, Victor, said he, that I do not suffer also? No one could love a child more than I loved your brothertears came into his eyes as he spoke but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society. This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations. 
Frankenstein  
126 of 345 
Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view. About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at ten oclock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenlyif I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shoreoften, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities forever. But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them exposed 
Frankenstein  
127 of 345 
and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them? At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I when there have precipitated him to their base. I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine. Our house was the house of mourning. My fathers health was deeply shaken by the 
Frankenstein  
128 of 345 
horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles. When I reflect, my dear cousin, said she, on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each others blood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake of a few jewels, to have 
Frankenstein  
129 of 345 
murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch. I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, My dearest friend, you must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, banish 
Frankenstein  
130 of 345 
these dark passions. Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap every tranquil blessing what can disturb our peace? And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her. Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me. Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the 
Frankenstein  
131 of 345 
near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then: I was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes. I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotenceand I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the 
Frankenstein  
132 of 345 
impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings. I passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous dome overlooked the valley. A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognized, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing 
Frankenstein  
133 of 345 
accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the kindly influence ceased to act I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myselfor, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair. At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured. For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion. 
Frankenstein

Chapter 10 
I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it. In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on 
Frankenstein  
135 of 345 
and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountaintop, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace. Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of soul- inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence 
Frankenstein  
136 of 345 
of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene. The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend nigher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only 
Frankenstein  
137 of 345 
renders them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us. We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep. We rise; one wandring thought pollutes the day. We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep, Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away; It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow, The path of its departure still is free. Mans yesterday may neer be like his morrow; Nought may endure but mutability!  It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful 
Frankenstein  
138 of 345 
and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life. As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred 
Frankenstein  
139 of 345 
had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt. Devil, I exclaimed, do you dare approach me? And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered! I expected this reception, said the daemon. All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends. Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with your creation, come on, 
Frankenstein  
140 of 345 
then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed. My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another. He easily eluded me and said Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent 
Frankenstein  
141 of 345 
and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous. Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall. How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for 
Frankenstein  
142 of 345 
you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands. Why do you call to my remembrance, I rejoined, circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from the sight of your detested form. Thus I relieve thee, my creator, he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with 
Frankenstein  
143 of 345 
violence; thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit forever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin. As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to 
Frankenstein  
144 of 345 
comply with his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.

Chapter 11 
It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and 
Frankenstein  
146 of 345 
thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep. It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept. Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.* [*The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries. I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I 
Frankenstein  
147 of 345 
could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure. Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again. The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found 
Frankenstein  
148 of 345 
that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing. One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep. It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly 
Frankenstein  
149 of 345 
fanned it into a flame. I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved. Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had 
Frankenstein  
150 of 345 
taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground. It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherds breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did 
Frankenstein  
151 of 345 
not like. Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep. It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasants breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! the huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however, was 
Frankenstein  
152 of 345 
placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain. Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me. Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of 
Frankenstein  
153 of 345 
the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm. Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself. She 
Frankenstein  
154 of 345 
followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard. On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate. Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until 
Frankenstein  
155 of 345 
she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions. Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together. The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat. The meal was 
Frankenstein  
156 of 345 
quickly dispatched. The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields. Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were 
Frankenstein  
157 of 345 
monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old mans instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters. The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest. 
Frankenstein  
158 of 345 
Chapter 12 
I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions. The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal. This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They performed towards him every 
Frankenstein  
159 of 345 
little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles. They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one anothers company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic. A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could 
Frankenstein  
160 of 345 
scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves. This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood. I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days. I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest 
Frankenstein  
161 of 345 
that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden. By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, fire, milk, bread, and wood. I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was father. The girl was called sister or Agatha, and the youth Felix, brother, or son. I cannot describe the 
Frankenstein  
162 of 345 
delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as good, dearest, unhappy. I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys. I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. But if his 
Frankenstein  
163 of 345 
countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man. I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha. This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I 
Frankenstein  
164 of 345 
did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted. I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagerstheir grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity. As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, 
Frankenstein  
165 of 345 
but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced. The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been. My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words good spirit, wonderful; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms. 
Frankenstein  
166 of 345 
My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love. These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration. 
Frankenstein  
167 of 345 
The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy. 
Frankenstein  
168 of 345 
Chapter 13 
I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am. Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty. It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labourthe old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to himthat I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his sons sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door. It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit and 
Frankenstein  
169 of 345 
covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink. Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young 
Frankenstein  
170 of 345 
stranger knelt at the old mans feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately. I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.

As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, Good night sweet Safie. He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible. The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods. When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music. 
Frankenstein

The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors. In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered. My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken. 
Frankenstein  
173 of 345 
While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight. The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volneys Ruins of Empires. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romansof their subsequent degeneratingof the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants. These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and 
Frankenstein  
174 of 345 
at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing. Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood. The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And 
Frankenstein  
175 of 345 
what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned? I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that I had forever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat! Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was deatha state which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from 
Frankenstein  
176 of 345 
intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch! Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds. But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with 
Frankenstein  
177 of 345 
me. What was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans. I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).

Chapter 14 
Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was. The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford. The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him. He was tried and 
Frankenstein  
179 of 345 
condemned to death. The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation. Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard. 
Frankenstein  
180 of 345 
The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness. During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate. I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you. 
Frankenstein  
181 of 345 
Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her. The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under 
Frankenstein  
182 of 345 
the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris. Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions. Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country. The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited. He revolved a thousand 
Frankenstein  
183 of 345 
plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris. The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and DeLacey and Agatha were thrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding. He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country. 
Frankenstein  
184 of 345 
They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance. Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul. When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate. 
Frankenstein  
185 of 345 
A few days after, the Turk entered his daughters apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn. When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany. She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell 
Frankenstein  
186 of 345 
dangerously ill. Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however, into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.

Chapter 15 
Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind. As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year. One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a volume of Plutarchs Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter. 
Frankenstein  
188 of 345 
The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations. I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the Sorrows of Werter, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were forever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of 
Frankenstein  
189 of 345 
the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it. As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener. I sympathized with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none. The path of my departure was free, and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them. The volume of Plutarchs Lives which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book had a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter. I learned from Werters imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty 
Frankenstein  
190 of 345 
rivers, and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations. But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was 
Frankenstein  
191 of 345 
apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me. Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are. Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set 
Frankenstein  
192 of 345 
in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. Hateful day when I received life! I exclaimed in agony. Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred. These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail. Besides, I found that my 
Frankenstein  
193 of 345 
understanding improved so much with every days experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity. Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade. I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all 
Frankenstein  
194 of 345 
a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adams supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him. Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer. They loved and sympathized with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away. I 
Frankenstein  
195 of 345 
asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it. The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone. I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors. One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his countenance 
Frankenstein  
196 of 345 
was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection. My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes or realize my fears. The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage. I knocked. Who is there? said the old man. Come in. I entered. Pardon this intrusion, said I; I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire. Enter, said De Lacey, and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you. 
Frankenstein  
197 of 345 
Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need. I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me. By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French? No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes. Are they Germans? No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world forever. Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair. 
Frankenstein  
198 of 345 
They are kindthey are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster. That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them? I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome. Where do these friends reside? Near this spot. The old man paused and then continued, If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.

Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures. Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes. How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be forever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting. May I know the names and residence of those friends? I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever. I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, Now is the time! Save and protect me! You 
Frankenstein  
200 of 345 
and your family are the friends whom I seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial! Great God! exclaimed the old man. Who are you? At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.

Chapter 16 
Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery. When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a staglike swiftness. Oh! What a miserable night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and finding myself unsympathized with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin. 
Frankenstein  
202 of 345 
But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery. The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation. The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared 
Frankenstein  
203 of 345 
for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party. These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was forever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his fathers feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hidingplace, and went in search of food. When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace. I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspense. Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent 
Frankenstein  
204 of 345 
gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances. Do you consider, said his companion to him, that you will be obliged to pay three months rent and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination. It is utterly useless, replied Felix; we can never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place. Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more. 
Frankenstein  
205 of 345 
I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As night advanced I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations. As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, 
Frankenstein  
206 of 345 
my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues. As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods. And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth. You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to proceed. But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination, 
Frankenstein  
207 of 345 
but the sun was my only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form. My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided. I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were 
Frankenstein  
208 of 345 
hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings. I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me. 
Frankenstein  
209 of 345 
I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood. 
Frankenstein  
210 of 345 
This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted. For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured. After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure. 
Frankenstein  
211 of 345 
But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva. It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura. At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth. Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me. 
Frankenstein  
212 of 345 
He struggled violently. Let me go, he cried; monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa. Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me. Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a Syndic he is M. Frankensteinhe will punish you. You dare not keep me. Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemyto him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim. The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet. I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, I too can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him. As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; 
Frankenstein  
213 of 345 
but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright. Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them. While l was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over her and whispered, Awake, fairest, thy lover is nearhe who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake! 
Frankenstein  
214 of 345 
The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within menot I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am forever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled. For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries forever. At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. My companion must 
Frankenstein  
215 of 345 
be of the same species and have the same defects. This being you must create.

The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He continued, You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede. The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me. I do refuse it, I replied; and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent. 
Frankenstein  
217 of 345 
You are in the wrong, replied the fiend; and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my archenemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth. A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded- 
Frankenstein  
218 of 345 
I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creatures sake I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request! I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling and continued, 
Frankenstein  
219 of 345 
If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire. You propose, replied I, to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent. 
Frankenstein  
220 of 345 
How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker. His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathize with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow. You swear, I said, to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge? 
Frankenstein  
221 of 345 
How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and became linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded. I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning to him, therefore, I said, 
Frankenstein  
222 of 345 
I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile. I swear, he cried, by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear. Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice. His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the halfway 
Frankenstein  
223 of 345 
resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, Oh! Stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness. These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me. Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensationsthey weighed on me with a mountains weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed 
Frankenstein  
224 of 345 
under a banas if I had no right to claim their sympathies as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life.

Chapter 18 
Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my fathers consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with 
Frankenstein  
226 of 345 
a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart. It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me, I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all. I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in 
Frankenstein  
227 of 345 
dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel. My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union. The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You are 
Frankenstein  
228 of 345 
younger; yet l do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity. I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I expected peace. I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country 
Frankenstein  
229 of 345 
whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my fathers house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart forever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery forever. These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that 
Frankenstein  
230 of 345 
resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself. The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasbourg. This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress? To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My fathers age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one 
Frankenstein  
231 of 345 
reward I promised myself from my detested toils one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her. I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations. It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she 
Frankenstein  
232 of 345 
was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clervaland yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a womans sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell. I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured. After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasbourg, where I waited two days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the 
Frankenstein  
233 of 345 
shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky. This is what it is to live, he cried; how I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful! In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment. We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourg to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns. We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasbourg, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking 
Frankenstein  
234 of 345 
tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene. We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had been transported to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. I have seen, he said, the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest 
Frankenstein  
235 of 345 
and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled. Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country. Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the very poetry of nature. His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the world-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not 
Frankenstein  
236 of 345 
sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour: -The sounding cataract  Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and their forms, were then to him An appetite; a feeling, and a love, That had no need of a remoter charm, By thought supplied, or any interest Unborrowd from the eye.* [*Wordsworths Tintern Abbey".] And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;  has this mind perished? Does it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend. Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my tale. 
Frankenstein  
237 of 345 
Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us. Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich places which I had heard of even in my country. At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Pauls towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history. 
Frankenstein  
238 of 345 
Chapter 19 
London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers. If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood 
Frankenstein  
239 of 345 
of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish. But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan. He was forever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every 
Frankenstein  
240 of 345 
word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate. After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places. We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland. We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful 
Frankenstein  
241 of 345 
forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us. From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees. 
Frankenstein  
242 of 345 
I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to bea miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself. We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and 
Frankenstein  
243 of 345 
lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self. We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated. From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in 
Frankenstein  
244 of 345 
the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. I could pass my life here, said he to me; and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine. But he found that a travellers life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are forever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties. We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the daemons disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable 
Frankenstein  
245 of 345 
and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime. I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthurs Seat, St. Bernards Well, and the Pentland Hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey. We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrews, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But I was in no mood to 
Frankenstein  
246 of 345 
laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone. Do you, said I, enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper. Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. I had rather be with you, he said, in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence. Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his companion. With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly 
Frankenstein  
247 of 345 
more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant. On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men. In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared 
Frankenstein  
248 of 345 
and dashed at my feet. It was a monotonous yet everchanging scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean. In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands. Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in 
Frankenstein  
249 of 345 
which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion. In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom. 
Frankenstein  
250 of 345 
Chapter 20 
I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it forever with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it 
Frankenstein  
251 of 345 
came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species. Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race. I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the light of the moon the daemon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted 
Frankenstein  
252 of 345 
to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfillment of my promise. As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew. I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries. Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the 
Frankenstein  
253 of 345 
silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house. In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot. Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice, You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes? 
Frankenstein  
254 of 345 
Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness. Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master; obey! The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage. The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger. Shall each man, cried he, find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn. Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness forever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness? You 
Frankenstein  
255 of 345 
can blast my other passions, but revenge remains revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict. Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable. It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night. I started forward and exclaimed, Villain! Before you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe. I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves. All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.

Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And then I thought again of his words *I will be with you on your wedding-night*. That, then, was the period fixed for the fulfillment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle. The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last nights contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I 
Frankenstein  
257 of 345 
returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a daemon whom I had myself created. I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality. The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. 
Frankenstein

He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days. Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into 
Frankenstein  
259 of 345 
a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus. Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the daemon. I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion. Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore. The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with 
Frankenstein  
260 of 345 
shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly. I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before 
Frankenstein  
261 of 345 
the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave. Fiend, I exclaimed, your task is already fulfilled! I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clervalall left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me forever, I shudder to reflect on it. Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south. 
Frankenstein  
262 of 345 
Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes. How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man. I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape. As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with 
Frankenstein  
263 of 345 
gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. My good friends, said I, will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am? You will know that soon enough, replied a man with a hoarse voice. Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you. I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions. Why do you answer me so roughly? I replied. Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably. I do not know, said the man, what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains. While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound 
Frankenstein  
264 of 345 
arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwins to give an account of yourself. Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free country? Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night. This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death. I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection.

Chapter 21 
I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion. About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-inlaw, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten oclock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead. Their first 
Frankenstein  
266 of 345 
supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck. The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner. The son confirmed his fathers account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed. 
Frankenstein  
267 of 345 
A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found. Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone. Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed. Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of from the place where I had deposited the corpse. Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight 
Frankenstein  
268 of 345 
of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair. I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor 
Frankenstein  
269 of 345 
The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions. A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses. Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture? 
Frankenstein  
270 of 345 
But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by jailers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly. This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of misery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings. Are you better now, sir? said she. I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror. 
Frankenstein  
271 of 345 
For that matter, replied the old woman, if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, thats none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same. I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality. As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee? These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness. He had 
Frankenstein  
272 of 345 
caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals. One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French, I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable? 
Frankenstein  
273 of 345 
I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving. I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge. That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me? Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path. As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was 
Frankenstein  
274 of 345 
exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say, Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter. But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind. This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament? Your family is perfectly well, said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; and someone, a friend, is come to visit you. I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony, Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for Gods sake, do not let him enter! 
Frankenstein  
275 of 345 
Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone, I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance. My father! cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure. Is my father indeed come? How kind, how very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me? My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it. Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried, Are you, then, safeand Elizabethand Ernest? My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of 
Frankenstein  
276 of 345 
cheerfulness. What a place is this that you inhabit, my son! said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room. You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. And poor Clerval The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears. Alas! Yes, my father, replied I; some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry. We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health. As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was forever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and 
Frankenstein  
277 of 345 
detested a life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins. The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison. My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to 
Frankenstein  
278 of 345 
breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned forever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt. My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring *maladie du pays*, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of 
Frankenstein  
279 of 345 
anguish and despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence. Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreckthe shadow of a human being. My strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame. Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores. It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the 
Frankenstein  
280 of 345 
darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my memory, my whole lifemy quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly. Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a 
Frankenstein  
281 of 345 
thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiends grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.

Chapter 22 
The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey. My fathers care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me! My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of 
Frankenstein  
283 of 345 
murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride. Alas! My father, said I, how little do you know me. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of thisI murdered her. William, Justine, and Henrythey all died by my hands. My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would forever have chained my tongue. But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would

have given the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe. Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again. I am not mad, I cried energetically; the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race. The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.

As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost selfviolence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice. A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland I received the following letter from Elizabeth: My dear Friend, It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity. Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by 
Frankenstein  
286 of 345 
time. I would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet. Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied. But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin. You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth Do you not love another? 
Frankenstein  
287 of 345 
You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word honour, all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that 
Frankenstein  
288 of 345 
nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity. Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness. Elizabeth Lavenza Geneva, May 18th, 17 This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend*I will be with you on your wedding-night!* Such was my sentence, and on that night would the daemon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and 
Frankenstein  
289 of 345 
alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death. Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angels arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed *to be with me on my weddingnight*, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my fathers happiness, my adversarys designs against my life should not retard it a single hour. 
Frankenstein  
290 of 345 
In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate. I fear, my beloved girl, I said, little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply. In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeths letter we returned to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was. The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of 
Frankenstein  
291 of 345 
what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me. Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief. Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth. I remained silent. Have you, then, some other attachment? None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin. My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost 
Frankenstein  
292 of 345 
to those who yet live. Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived. Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words *I shall be with you on your wedding-night*, I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate. Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to 
Frankenstein  
293 of 345 
his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim. As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the everwatchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret. Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy. Through my fathers exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should 
Frankenstein  
294 of 345 
proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood. In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnization drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent. Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride. 
Frankenstein  
295 of 345 
After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my fathers, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation. Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it. I took the hand of Elizabeth. You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy. 
Frankenstein  
296 of 345 
Be happy, my dear Victor, replied Elizabeth; there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature appears! Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie. The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that 
Frankenstein  
297 of 345 
surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung. The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me forever. 
Frankenstein  
298 of 345 
Chapter 23 
It was eight oclock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines. The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended. I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished. 
Frankenstein  
299 of 345 
Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you fear? Oh! Peace, peace, my love, replied I; this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful. I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy. She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities 
Frankenstein  
300 of 345 
of my limbs. This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room. Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I turn I see the same figure her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas! Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground. When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in 
Frankenstein  
301 of 345 
my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The murderous mark of the fiends grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips. While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up. The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake. The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they 
Frankenstein  
302 of 345 
proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines. I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost. After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet. This idea made me shudder and 
Frankenstein  
303 of 345 
recalled me to action. I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed. There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had 
Frankenstein  
304 of 345 
ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man. But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their acme, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration. I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delighthis Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms. What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed 
Frankenstein  
305 of 345 
upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation. Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their causethe monster whom I had created, the miserable daemon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head. Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my 
Frankenstein  
306 of 345 
family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer. The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. Be assured, sir, said he, no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain. I thank you, replied I; listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood. My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation. The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance. 
Frankenstein  
307 of 345 
When I had concluded my narration I said, This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion. This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit. I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of 
Frankenstein  
308 of 345 
prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert. As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated. You are mistaken, said he. I will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment. That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction. I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of 
Frankenstein  
309 of 345 
devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium. Man, I cried, how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say. I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action. 
Frankenstein  
310 of 345 
Chapter 24 
My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion. My first resolution was to quit Geneva forever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed. And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being. When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish 
Frankenstein  
311 of 345 
enemy. But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner. The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the daemon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, 
Frankenstein  
312 of 345 
which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me. I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance. I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have determined to live, and I am satisfied. I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his 
Frankenstein  
313 of 345 
ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed. I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how. Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, 
Frankenstein  
314 of 345 
when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish. I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the daemon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking. My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my 
Frankenstein  
315 of 345 
pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeths voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. What agonizing fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the daemon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul. What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury. My reign is not yet over these words were legible in one of these inscriptions you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I seek the 
Frankenstein  
316 of 345 
everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive. Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage! As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance. The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One inscription that he left was in these words: Prepare! Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in 
Frankenstein  
317 of 345 
furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred. My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversarys gibe, to meet and grapple with him. Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one days 
Frankenstein  
318 of 345 
journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts. On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair. He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a 
Frankenstein  
319 of 345 
mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey. I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land. I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure. By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I 
Frankenstein  
320 of 345 
viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart! Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the daemon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud. But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hours rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me. But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all 
Frankenstein  
321 of 345 
trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death. In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life. I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me 
Frankenstein  
322 of 345 
on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled. Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the daemon, allow me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone? No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiendlike malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the steel aright. Walton, in continuation. August 26th, 17 
Frankenstein  
323 of 345 
You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor. His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence! I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of 
Frankenstein  
324 of 345 
his creatures formation, but on this point he was impenetrable. Are you mad, my friend? said he. Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own. Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy. Since you have preserved my narration, said he, I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity. Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; 
Frankenstein  
325 of 345 
he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth. Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall. When younger, said he, I believed myself destined for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in 
Frankenstein  
326 of 345 
useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognize me in this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise. Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would sympathize with 
Frankenstein  
327 of 345 
and love me. Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea. I thank you, Walton, he said, for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the 
Frankenstein  
328 of 345 
conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die. My beloved Sister, September 2nd I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause. And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! 
Frankenstein  
329 of 345 
My beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so! My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair. September 5th A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it. We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades 
Frankenstein  
330 of 345 
have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness. I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards. This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, 
Frankenstein  
331 of 345 
in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said, What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then, so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm 
Frankenstein  
332 of 345 
firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe. He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return. They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life. How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. 
Frankenstein  
333 of 345 
Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships. September 7th The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed. Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience. September 12th It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility and glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted towards England and towards you, I will not despond. September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards 
Frankenstein  
334 of 345 
the south became perfectly free. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult. They shout, I said, because they will soon return to England. Do you, then, really return? Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must return. Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength. Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted. It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live. His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called 
Frankenstein  
335 of 345 
to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to 
Frankenstein  
336 of 345 
undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue. Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion. That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell, Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed. His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed 
Frankenstein  
337 of 345 
forever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips. Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation. I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine. Good night, my sister. Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe. I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my illfated and admirable friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describegigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions. As he hung over 
Frankenstein  
338 of 345 
the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay. He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion. That is also my victim! he exclaimed. In his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer me. His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying 
Frankenstein  
339 of 345 
request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion. Your repentance, I said, is now superfluous. If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived. And do you dream? said the daemon. Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse? He, he continued, pointing to the corpse, he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and 
Frankenstein  
340 of 345 
hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine. After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was forever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim! I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of 
Frankenstein  
341 of 345 
his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me. Wretch! I said. It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power. Oh, it is not thusnot thus, interrupted the being. Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed 
Frankenstein  
342 of 345 
with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone. You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires. They were forever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his 
Frankenstein  
343 of 345 
friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice. But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more. Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any mans death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to 
Frankenstein  
344 of 345 
perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death? Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a 
Frankenstein  
345 of 345 
desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them forever. But soon, he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell. He sprang from the cabin window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.

PREFATORY NOTE
The Introduction, the Commentary to the two tablets, and the Appendix, are by Professor Jastrow, and for these he assumes the sole responsibility. The text of the Yale tablet is by Professor Clay. The transliteration and the translation of the two tablets represent the joint work of the two authors. In the transliteration of the two tablets, C. E. Keiser's "System of Accentuation for Sumero-Akkadian signs" (Yale Oriental Researches--VOL. IX, Appendix, New Haven, 1919) has been followed.
INTRODUCTION.
I.
The Gilgamesh Epic is the most notable literary product of Babylonia as yet discovered in the mounds of Mesopotamia. It recounts the exploits and adventures of a favorite hero, and in its final form covers twelve
tablets, each tablet consisting of six columns (three on the obverse and three on the reverse) of about 50 lines for each column, or a total of about 3600 lines. Of this total, however, barely more than one-half has been found among the remains of the great collection of cuneiform tablets gathered by King Ashurbanapal (668-626 B.C.) in his palace at Nineveh, and discovered by Layard in 1854 [1] in the course of his excavations of the mound Kouyunjik (opposite Mosul). The fragments of the epic painfully gathered--chiefly by George Smith--from the _circa_ 30,000 tablets and bits of tablets brought to the British Museum were published in model form by Professor Paul Haupt; [2] and that edition still remains the primary source for our study of the Epic. For the sake of convenience we may call the form of the Epic in the fragments from the library of Ashurbanapal the Assyrian version, though like most of the literary productions in the library it not only reverts to a Babylonian original, but represents a late copy of a much older original. The absence of any reference to Assyria in the fragments recovered justifies us in assuming that the Assyrian version received its present form in Babylonia, perhaps in Erech; though it is of course possible that some of the late features, particularly the elaboration of the teachings of the theologians or schoolmen in the eleventh and twelfth tablets, may have been produced at least in part under Assyrian influence. A definite indication that the Gilgamesh Epic reverts to a period earlier than Hammurabi (or Hammurawi) [3] i.e., beyond 2000 B. C., was furnished by the publication of a text clearly belonging to the first Babylonian dynasty (of which Hammurabi was the sixth member) in _CT_. VI, 5; which text Zimmern [4] recognized as a part of the tale of Atra-hasis, one of the names given to the survivor of the deluge, recounted on the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh Epic. [5] This was confirmed by the discovery [6] of a fragment of the deluge story dated in the eleventh year of Ammisaduka, i.e., c. 1967 B.C. In this text, likewise, the name of the deluge hero appears as Atra-hasis (col. VIII, 4). [7] But while these two tablets do not belong to the Gilgamesh Epic and merely introduce an episode which has also been incorporated into the Epic, Dr. Bruno Meissner in 1902 published a tablet, dating, as the writing and the internal evidence showed, from the Hammurabi period, which undoubtedly is a portion of what by way of distinction we may call an old Babylonian version. [8] It was picked up by Dr. Meissner at a dealer's shop in Bagdad and acquired for the Berlin Museum. The tablet consists of four columns (two on the obverse and two on the reverse) and deals with the hero's wanderings in search of a cure from disease with which he has been smitten after the death of his companion Enkidu. The hero fears that the disease will be fatal and longs to escape death. It corresponds to a portion of Tablet X of the Assyrian version. Unfortunately, only the lower portion of the obverse and the upper of the reverse have been preserved (57 lines in all); and in default of a colophon we do not know the numeration of the tablet in this old Babylonian edition. Its chief value, apart from its furnishing a proof for the existence of the Epic as early as 2000 B. C., lies (a) in the writing _Gish_ instead of Gish-gi(n)-mash in the Assyrian version, for the name of the hero, (b) in the writing En-ki-du--abbreviated from dug--"Enki is good" for En-ki-d in the Assyrian version, [9] and (c) in the remarkable address of the maiden Sabitum, dwelling at the seaside, to whom Gilgamesh comes in the course of his wanderings. From the Assyrian version we know that the hero tells the maiden of his grief for his lost companion, and of his longing to escape the dire fate of Enkidu. In the old Babylonian fragment the answer of Sabitum is given
in full, and the sad note that it strikes, showing how hopeless it is for man to try to escape death which is in store for all mankind, is as remarkable as is the philosophy of "eat, drink and be merry" which Sabitum imparts. The address indicates how early the tendency arose to attach to ancient tales the current religious teachings.
        "Why, O Gish, does thou run about?        The life that thou seekest, thou wilt not find.        When the gods created mankind,        Death they imposed on mankind;        Life they kept in their power.        Thou, O Gish, fill thy belly,        Day and night do thou rejoice,        Daily make a rejoicing!        Day and night a renewal of jollification!        Let thy clothes be clean,        Wash thy head and pour water over thee!        Care for the little one who takes hold of thy hand!        Let the wife rejoice in thy bosom!"
Such teachings, reminding us of the leading thought in the Biblical Book of Ecclesiastes, [10] indicate the _didactic_ character given to ancient tales that were of popular origin, but which were modified and elaborated under the influence of the schools which arose in connection with the Babylonian temples. The story itself belongs, therefore, to a still earlier period than the form it received in this old Babylonian version. The existence of this tendency at so early a date comes to us as a genuine surprise, and justifies the assumption that the attachment of a lesson to the deluge story in the Assyrian version, to wit, the limitation in attainment of immortality to those singled out by the gods as exceptions, dates likewise from the old Babylonian period. The same would apply to the twelfth tablet, which is almost entirely didactic, intended to illustrate the impossibility of learning anything of the fate of those who have passed out of this world. It also emphasizes the necessity of contenting oneself with the comfort that the care of the dead, by providing burial and food and drink offerings for them affords, as the only means of ensuring for them rest and freedom from the pangs of hunger and distress. However, it is of course possible that the twelfth tablet, which impresses one as a supplement to the adventures of Gilgamesh, ending with his return to Uruk (i.e., Erech) at the close of the eleventh tablet, may represent a _later_ elaboration of the tendency to connect religious teachings with the exploits of a favorite hero.
II.
We now have further evidence both of the extreme antiquity of the literary form of the Gilgamesh Epic and also of the disposition to make the Epic the medium of illustrating aspects of life and the destiny of mankind. The discovery by Dr. Arno Poebel of a Sumerian form of the tale of the descent of Ishtar to the lower world and her release [11]--apparently a nature myth to illustrate the change of season from summer to winter and back again to spring--enables us to pass beyond the Akkadian (or Semitic) form of tales current in the
Euphrates Valley to the Sumerian form. Furthermore, we are indebted to Dr. Langdon for the identification of two Sumerian fragments in the Nippur Collection which deal with the adventures of Gilgamesh, one in Constantinople, [12] the other in the collection of the University of Pennsylvania Museum. [13] The former, of which only 25 lines are preserved (19 on the obverse and 6 on the reverse), appears to be a description of the weapons of Gilgamesh with which he arms himself for an encounter--presumably the encounter with Humbaba or Huwawa, the ruler of the cedar forest in the mountain. [14] The latter deals with the building operations of Gilgamesh in the city of Erech. A text in Zimmern's _Sumerische Kultlieder aus altbabylonischer Zeit_ (Leipzig, 1913), No. 196, appears likewise to be a fragment of the Sumerian version of the Gilgamesh Epic, bearing on the episode of Gilgamesh's and Enkidu's relations to the goddess Ishtar, covered in the sixth and seventh tablets of the Assyrian version. [15] Until, however, further fragments shall have turned up, it would be hazardous to institute a comparison between the Sumerian and the Akkadian versions. All that can be said for the present is that there is every reason to believe in the existence of a literary form of the Epic in Sumerian which presumably antedated the Akkadian recension, just as we have a Sumerian form of Ishtar's descent into the nether world, and Sumerian versions of creation myths, as also of the Deluge tale. [16] It does not follow, however, that the Akkadian versions of the Gilgamesh Epic are translations of the Sumerian, any more than that the Akkadian creation myths are translations of a Sumerian original. Indeed, in the case of the creation myths, the striking difference between the Sumerian and Akkadian views of creation [17] points to the independent production of creation stories on the part of the Semitic settlers of the Euphrates Valley, though no doubt these were worked out in part under Sumerian literary influences. The same is probably true of Deluge tales, which would be given a distinctly Akkadian coloring in being reproduced and steadily elaborated by the Babylonian _literati_ attached to the temples. The presumption is, therefore, in favor of an independent _literary_ origin for the Semitic versions of the Gilgamesh Epic, though naturally with a duplication of the episodes, or at least of some of them, in the Sumerian narrative. Nor does the existence of a Sumerian form of the Epic necessarily prove that it originated with the Sumerians in their earliest home before they came to the Euphrates Valley. They may have adopted it after their conquest of southern Babylonia from the Semites who, there are now substantial grounds for believing, were the earlier settlers in the Euphrates Valley. [18] We must distinguish, therefore, between the earliest _literary_ form, which was undoubtedly Sumerian, and the _origin_ of the episodes embodied in the Epic, including the chief actors, Gilgamesh and his companion Enkidu. It will be shown that one of the chief episodes, the encounter of the two heroes with a powerful guardian or ruler of a cedar forest, points to a western region, more specifically to Amurru, as the scene. The names of the two chief actors, moreover, appear to have been "Sumerianized" by an artificial process, [19] and if this view turns out to be correct, we would have a further ground for assuming the tale to have originated among the Akkadian settlers and to have been taken over from them by the Sumerians.
III.
New light on the earliest Babylonian version of the Epic, as well as on the Assyrian version, has been shed by the recovery of two substantial fragments of the form which the Epic had assumed in Babylonia in the Hammurabi period. The study of this important new material also enables us to advance the interpretation of the Epic and to perfect the analysis into its component parts. In the spring of 1914, the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania acquired by purchase a large tablet, the writing of which as well as the style and the manner of spelling verbal forms and substantives pointed distinctly to the time of the first Babylonian dynasty. The tablet was identified by Dr. Arno Poebel as part of the Gilgamesh Epic; and, as the colophon showed, it formed the second tablet of the series. He copied it with a view to publication, but the outbreak of the war which found him in Germany--his native country--prevented him from carrying out this intention. [20] He, however, utilized some of its contents in his discussion of the historical or semi-historical traditions about Gilgamesh, as revealed by the important list of partly mythical and partly historical dynasties, found among the tablets of the Nippur collection, in which Gilgamesh occurs [21] as a King of an Erech dynasty, whose father was , a priest of Kulab. [22] The publication of the tablet was then undertaken by Dr. Stephen Langdon in monograph form under the title, "The Epic of Gilgamish." [23] In a preliminary article on the tablet in the _Museum Journal_, Vol. VIII, pages 29-38, Dr. Langdon took the tablet to be of the late Persian period (i.e., between the sixth and third century B. C.), but his attention having been called to this error of some _1500 years_, he corrected it in his introduction to his edition of the text, though he neglected to change some of his notes in which he still refers to the text as "late." [24] In addition to a copy of the text, accompanied by a good photograph, Dr. Langdon furnished a transliteration and translation with some notes and a brief introduction. The text is unfortunately badly copied, being full of errors; and the translation is likewise very defective. A careful collation with the original tablet was made with the assistance of Dr. Edward Chiera, and as a consequence we are in a position to offer to scholars a correct text. We beg to acknowledge our obligations to Dr. Gordon, the Director of the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, for kindly placing the tablet at our disposal. Instead of republishing the text, I content myself with giving a full list of corrections in the appendix to this volume which will enable scholars to control our readings, and which will, I believe, justify the translation in the numerous passages in which it deviates from Dr. Langdon's rendering. While credit should be given to Dr. Langdon for having made this important tablet accessible, the interests of science demand that attention be called to his failure to grasp the many important data furnished by the tablet, which escaped him because of his erroneous readings and faulty translations. The tablet, consisting of six columns (three on the obverse and three on the reverse), comprised, according to the colophon, 240 lines [25] and formed the second tablet of the series. Of the total, 204 lines are preserved in full or in part, and of the missing thirty-six quite a number can be restored, so that we have a fairly complete tablet. The most serious break occurs at the top of the reverse, where about eight lines are missing. In consequence of this the connection between the end of the obverse (where about five lines are missing) and the beginning of the reverse is obscured, though not to the extent
of our entirely losing the thread of the narrative. About the same time that the University of Pennsylvania Museum purchased this second tablet of the Gilgamesh Series, Yale University obtained a tablet from the same dealer, which turned out to be a continuation of the University of Pennsylvania tablet. That the two belong to the same edition of the Epic is shown by their agreement in the dark brown color of the clay, in the writing as well as in the size of the tablet, though the characters on the Yale tablet are somewhat cramped and in consequence more difficult to read. Both tablets consist of six columns, three on the obverse and three on the reverse. The measurements of both are about the same, the Pennsylvania tablet being estimated at about 7 inches high, as against 7 2/16 inches for the Yale tablet, while the width of both is 6 1/2 inches. The Yale tablet is, however, more closely written and therefore has a larger number of lines than the Pennsylvania tablet. The colophon to the Yale tablet is unfortunately missing, but from internal evidence it is quite certain that the Yale tablet follows immediately upon the Pennsylvania tablet and, therefore, may be set down as the third of the series. The obverse is very badly preserved, so that only a general view of its contents can be secured. The reverse contains serious gaps in the first and second columns. The scribe evidently had a copy before him which he tried to follow exactly, but finding that he could not get all of the copy before him in the six columns, he continued the last column on the edge. In this way we obtain for the sixth column 64 lines as against 45 for column IV, and 47 for column V, and a total of 292 lines for the six columns. Subtracting the 16 lines written on the edge leaves us 276 lines for our tablet as against 240 for its companion. The width of each column being the same on both tablets, the difference of 36 lines is made up by the closer writing. Both tablets have peculiar knobs at the sides, the purpose of which is evidently not to facilitate holding the tablet in one's hand while writing or reading it, as Langdon assumed [26] (it would be quite impracticable for this purpose), but simply to protect the tablet in its position on a shelf, where it would naturally be placed on the edge, just as we arrange books on a shelf. Finally be it noted that these two tablets of the old Babylonian version do not belong to the same edition as the Meissner tablet above described, for the latter consists of two columns each on obverse and reverse, as against three columns each in the case of our two tablets. We thus have the interesting proof that as early as 2000 B.C. there were already several editions of the Epic. As to the provenance of our two tablets, there are no definite data, but it is likely that they were found by natives in the mounds at Warka, from which about the year 1913, many tablets came into the hands of dealers. It is likely that where two tablets of a series were found, others of the series were also dug up, and we may expect to find some further portions of this old Babylonian version turning up in the hands of other dealers or in museums.
IV.
Coming to the contents of the two tablets, the Pennsylvania tablet deals with the meeting of the two heroes, Gilgamesh and Enkidu, their conflict, followed by their reconciliation, while the Yale tablet in continuation takes up the preparations for the encounter of
the two heroes with the guardian of the cedar forest, Humbaba--but probably pronounced Hubaba [27]--or, as the name appears in the old Babylonian version, Huwawa. The two tablets correspond, therefore, to portions of Tablets I to V of the Assyrian version; [28] but, as will be shown in detail further on, the number of _completely_ parallel passages is not large, and the Assyrian version shows an independence of the old Babylonian version that is larger than we had reason to expect. In general, it may be said that the Assyrian version is more elaborate, which points to its having received its present form at a considerably later period than the old Babylonian version. [29] On the other hand, we already find in the Babylonian version the tendency towards repetition, which is characteristic of Babylonian-Assyrian tales in general. Through the two Babylonian tablets we are enabled to fill out certain details of the two episodes with which they deal: (1) the meeting of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, and (2) the encounter with Huwawa; while their greatest value consists in the light that they throw on the gradual growth of the Epic until it reached its definite form in the text represented by the fragments in Ashurbanapal's Library. Let us now take up the detailed analysis, first of the Pennsylvania tablet and then of the Yale tablet. The Pennsylvania tablet begins with two dreams recounted by Gilgamesh to his mother, which the latter interprets as presaging the coming of Enkidu to Erech. In the one, something like a heavy meteor falls from heaven upon Gilgamesh and almost crushes him. With the help of the heroes of Erech, Gilgamesh carries the heavy burden to his mother Ninsun. The burden, his mother explains, symbolizes some one who, like Gilgamesh, is born in the mountains, to whom all will pay homage and of whom Gilgamesh will become enamoured with a love as strong as that for a woman. In a second dream, Gilgamesh sees some one who is like him, who brandishes an axe, and with whom he falls in love. This personage, the mother explains, is again Enkidu. Langdon is of the opinion that these dreams are recounted to Enkidu by a woman with whom Enkidu cohabits for six days and seven nights and who weans Enkidu from association with animals. This, however, cannot be correct. The scene between Enkidu and the woman must have been recounted in detail in the first tablet, as in the Assyrian version, [30] whereas here in the second tablet we have the continuation of the tale with Gilgamesh recounting his dreams directly to his mother. The story then continues with the description of the coming of Enkidu, conducted by the woman to the outskirts of Erech, where food is given him. The main feature of the incident is the conversion of Enkidu to civilized life. Enkidu, who hitherto had gone about naked, is clothed by the woman. Instead of sucking milk and drinking from a trough like an animal, food and strong drink are placed before him, and he is taught how to eat and drink in human fashion. In human fashion he also becomes drunk, and his "spree" is navely described: "His heart became glad and his face shone." [31] Like an animal, Enkidu's body had hitherto been covered with hair, which is now shaved off. He is anointed with oil, and clothed "like a man." Enkidu becomes a shepherd, protecting the fold against wild beasts, and his exploit in dispatching lions is briefly told. At this point--the end of column 3 (on the obverse), i.e., line 117, and the beginning of column 4 (on the reverse), i.e., line 131--a gap of 13 lines--the tablet is obscure, but apparently the story of Enkidu's gradual transformation from savagery to civilized life is continued, with stress upon his introduction to domestic ways with the wife chosen or decreed for him, and with work as part of his fate. All this has no connection with Gilgamesh, and it is evident that the
tale of Enkidu was originally an _independent_ tale to illustrate the evolution of man's career and destiny, how through intercourse with a woman he awakens to the sense of human dignity, how he becomes accustomed to the ways of civilization, how he passes through the pastoral stage to higher walks of life, how the family is instituted, and how men come to be engaged in the labors associated with human activities. In order to connect this tale with the Gilgamesh story, the two heroes are brought together; the woman taking on herself, in addition to the rle of civilizer, that of the medium through which Enkidu is brought to Gilgamesh. The woman leads Enkidu from the outskirts of Erech into the city itself, where the people on seeing him remark upon his likeness to Gilgamesh. He is the very counterpart of the latter, though somewhat smaller in stature. There follows the encounter between the two heroes in the streets of Erech, where they engage in a fierce combat. Gilgamesh is overcome by Enkidu and is enraged at being thrown to the ground. The tablet closes with the endeavor of Enkidu to pacify Gilgamesh. Enkidu declares that the mother of Gilgamesh has exalted her son above the ordinary mortal, and that Enlil himself has singled him out for royal prerogatives. After this, we may assume, the two heroes become friends and together proceed to carry out certain exploits, the first of which is an attack upon the mighty guardian of the cedar forest. This is the main episode in the Yale tablet, which, therefore, forms the third tablet of the old Babylonian version. In the first column of the obverse of the Yale tablet, which is badly preserved, it would appear that the elders of Erech (or perhaps the people) are endeavoring to dissuade Gilgamesh from making the attempt to penetrate to the abode of Huwawa. If this is correct, then the close of the first column may represent a conversation between these elders and the woman who accompanies Enkidu. It would be the elders who are represented as "reporting the speech to the woman," which is presumably the determination of Gilgamesh to fight Huwawa. The elders apparently desire Enkidu to accompany Gilgamesh in this perilous adventure, and with this in view appeal to the woman. In the second column after an obscure reference to the mother of Gilgamesh--perhaps appealing to the sun-god--we find Gilgamesh and Enkidu again face to face. From the reference to Enkidu's eyes "filled with tears," we may conclude that he is moved to pity at the thought of what will happen to Gilgamesh if he insists upon carrying out his purpose. Enkidu, also, tries to dissuade Gilgamesh. This appears to be the main purport of the dialogue between the two, which begins about the middle of the second column and extends to the end of the third column. Enkidu pleads that even his strength is insufficient,
        "My arms are lame,        My strength has become weak." (lines 88-89)
Gilgamesh apparently asks for a description of the terrible tyrant who thus arouses the fear of Enkidu, and in reply Enkidu tells him how at one time, when he was roaming about with the cattle, he penetrated into the forest and heard the roar of Huwawa which was like that of a deluge. The mouth of the tyrant emitted fire, and his breath was death. It is clear, as Professor Haupt has suggested, [32] that Enkidu furnishes the description of a volcano in eruption, with its mighty roar, spitting forth fire and belching out a suffocating
smoke. Gilgamesh is, however, undaunted and urges Enkidu to accompany him in the adventure. "I will go down to the forest," says Gilgamesh, if the conjectural restoration of the line in question (l. 126) is correct. Enkidu replies by again drawing a lurid picture of what will happen "When we go (together) to the forest......." This speech of Enkidu is continued on the reverse. In reply Gilgamesh emphasizes his reliance upon the good will of Shamash and reproaches Enkidu with cowardice. He declares himself superior to Enkidu's warning, and in bold terms says that he prefers to perish in the attempt to overcome Huwawa rather than abandon it.
        "Wherever terror is to be faced,        Thou, forsooth, art in fear of death.        Thy prowess lacks strength.        I will go before thee,        Though thy mouth shouts to me: 'thou art afraid to approach,'        If I fall, I will establish my name." (lines 143-148)
There follows an interesting description of the forging of the weapons for the two heroes in preparation for the encounter. [33] The elders of Erech when they see these preparations are stricken with fear. They learn of Huwawa's threat to annihilate Gilgamesh if he dares to enter the cedar forest, and once more try to dissuade Gilgamesh from the undertaking.
        "Thou art young, O Gish, and thy heart carries thee away,        Thou dost not know what thou proposest to do." (lines 190-191)
They try to frighten Gilgamesh by repeating the description of the terrible Huwawa. Gilgamesh is still undaunted and prays to his patron deity Shamash, who apparently accords him a favorable "oracle" (_trtu_). The two heroes arm themselves for the fray, and the elders of Erech, now reconciled to the perilous undertaking, counsel Gilgamesh to take provision along for the undertaking. They urge Gilgamesh to allow Enkidu to take the lead, for
        "He is acquainted with the way, he has trodden the road        [to] the entrance of the forest." (lines 252-253)
The elders dismiss Gilgamesh with fervent wishes that Enkidu may track out the "closed path" for Gilgamesh, and commit him to the care of Lugalbanda--here perhaps an epithet of Shamash. They advise Gilgamesh to perform certain rites, to wash his feet in the stream of Huwawa and to pour out a libation of water to Shamash. Enkidu follows in a speech likewise intended to encourage the hero; and with the actual beginning of the expedition against Huwawa the tablet ends. The encounter itself, with the triumph of the two heroes, must have been described in the fourth tablet.
V.
Now before taking up the significance of the additions to our knowledge of the Epic gained through these two tablets, it will be well to discuss the forms in which the names of the two heroes and of the ruler of the cedar forest occur in our tablets. As in the Meissner fragment, the chief hero is invariably designated as dGish in both the Pennsylvania and Yale tablets; and we may therefore conclude that this was the common form in the Hammurabi period, as against the writing dGish-g(n)-mash [34] in the Assyrian version. Similarly, as in the Meissner fragment, the second hero's name is always written En-ki-du [35] (abbreviated from dg) as against En-ki-d in the Assyrian version. Finally, we encounter in the Yale tablet for the first time the writing Hu-wa-wa as the name of the guardian of the cedar forest, as against Hum-ba-ba in the Assyrian version, though in the latter case, as we may now conclude from the Yale tablet, the name should rather be read Hu-ba-ba. [36] The variation in the writing of the latter name is interesting as pointing to the aspirate pronunciation of the labial in both instances. The name would thus present a complete parallel to the Hebrew name Howawa (or Hobab) who appears as the brother-in-law of Moses in the P document, Numbers 10, 29. [37] Since the name also occurs, written precisely as in the Yale tablet, among the "Amoritic" names in the important lists published by Dr. Chiera, [38] there can be no doubt that Huwawa or Hubaba is a West Semitic name. This important fact adds to the probability that the "cedar forest" in which Huwawa dwells is none other than the Lebanon district, famed since early antiquity for its cedars. This explanation of the name Huwawa disposes of suppositions hitherto brought forward for an Elamitic origin. Gressmann [39] still favors such an origin, though realizing that the description of the cedar forest points to the Amanus or Lebanon range. In further confirmation of the West Semitic origin of the name, we have in Lucian, _De Dea Syria_,  19, the name Kombabos [40] (the guardian of Stratonika), which forms a perfect parallel to Hu(m)baba. Of the important bearings of this western character of the name Huwawa on the interpretation and origin of the Gilgamesh Epic, suggesting that the episode of the encounter between the tyrant and the two heroes rests upon a tradition of an expedition against the West or Amurru land, we shall have more to say further on. The variation in the writing of the name Enkidu is likewise interesting. It is evident that the form in the old Babylonian version with the sign du (i.e., dg) is the original, for it furnishes us with a suitable etymology "Enki is good." The writing with dg, pronounced du, also shows that the sign d as the third element in the form which the name has in the Assyrian version is to be read d, and that former readings like Ea-bani must be definitely abandoned. [41] The form with d is clearly a _phonetic_ writing of the Sumerian name, the sign d being chosen to indicate the _pronunciation_ (not the ideograph) of the third element dg. This is confirmed by the writing En-gi-d in the syllabary _CT_ XVIII, 30, 10. The phonetic writing is, therefore, a warning against any endeavor to read the name by an Akkadian transliteration of the signs. This would not of itself prove that Enkidu is of Sumerian _origin_, for it might well be that the writing En-ki-d is an endeavor to give a Sumerian _aspect_ to a name that _may_ have been foreign. The element dg corresponds to the Semitic _tbu_, "good," and En-ki being originally a designation
of a deity as the "lord of the land," which would be the Sumerian manner of indicating a Semitic Baal, it is not at all impossible that En-ki-dg may be the "Sumerianized" form of a Semitic BA`L TZOB "Baal is good." It will be recalled that in the third column of the Yale tablet, Enkidu speaks of himself in his earlier period while still living with cattle, as wandering into the cedar forest of Huwawa, while in another passage (ll. 252-253) he is described as "acquainted with the way ... to the entrance of the forest." This would clearly point to the West as the original home of Enkidu. We are thus led once more to Amurru--taken as a general designation of the West--as playing an important role in the Gilgamesh Epic. [42] If Gilgamesh's expedition against Huwawa of the Lebanon district recalls a Babylonian campaign against Amurru, Enkidu's coming from his home, where, as we read repeatedly in the Assyrian version,
        "He ate herbs with the gazelles,        Drank out of a trough with cattle," [43]
may rest on a tradition of an Amorite invasion of Babylonia. The fight between Gilgamesh and Enkidu would fit in with this tradition, while the subsequent reconciliation would be the form in which the tradition would represent the enforced union between the invaders and the older settlers. Leaving this aside for the present, let us proceed to a consideration of the relationship of the form dGish, for the chief personage in the Epic in the old Babylonian version, to dGish-gi(n)-mash in the Assyrian version. Of the meaning of Gish there is fortunately no doubt. It is clearly the equivalent to the Akkadian _zikaru_, "man" (Brnnow No. 5707), or possibly _rab_, "great" (Brnnow No. 5704). Among various equivalents, the preference is to be given to _itlu_, "hero." The determinative for deity stamps the person so designated as deified, or as in part divine, and this is in accord with the express statement in the Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh Epic which describes the hero as
        "Two-thirds god and one-third human." [44]
Gish is, therefore, the hero-god _par excellence_; and this shows that we are not dealing with a genuine proper name, but rather with a descriptive attribute. Proper names are not formed in this way, either in Sumerian or Akkadian. Now what relation does this form Gish bear to
                            [FIGURE]
as the name of the hero is invariably written in the Assyrian version, the form which was at first read dIz-tu-bar or dGish-du-bar by scholars, until Pinches found in a neo-Babylonian syllabary [45] the equation of it with Gi-il-ga-mesh? Pinches' discovery pointed conclusively to the popular pronunciation of the hero's name as Gilgamesh; and since Aelian (_De natura Animalium_ XII, 2) mentions a Babylonian personage Gilgamos (though what he tells us of Gilgamos does not appear in our Epic, but seems to apply to Etana, another
figure of Babylonian mythology), there seemed to be no further reason to question that the problem had been solved. Besides, in a later Syriac list of Babylonian kings found in the Scholia of Theodor bar Koni, the name GLMGVM with a variant GMYGMVS occurs, [46] and it is evident that we have here again the Gi-il-ga-mesh, discovered by Pinches. The existence of an old Babylonian hero Gilgamesh who was likewise a king is thus established, as well as his identification with
                            [FIGURE]
It is evident that we cannot read this name as Iz-tu-bar or Gish-du-bar, but that we must read the first sign as Gish and the third as Mash, while for the second we must assume a reading Gn or Gi. This would give us Gish-g(n)-mash which is clearly again (like En-ki-d) not an etymological writing but a _phonetic_ one, intended to convey an _approach_ to the popular pronunciation. Gi-il-ga-mesh might well be merely a variant for Gish-ga-mesh, or _vice versa_, and this would come close to Gish-gi-mash. Now, when we have a name the pronunciation of which is not definite but approximate, and which is written in various ways, the probabilities are that the name is foreign. A foreign name might naturally be spelled in various ways. The Epic in the Assyrian version clearly depicts dGish-g(n)-mash as a conqueror of Erech, who forces the people into subjection, and whose autocratic rule leads the people of Erech to implore the goddess Aruru to create a rival to him who may withstand him. In response to this appeal dEnkidu is formed out of dust by Aruru and eventually brought to Erech. [47] Gish-g(n)-mash or Gilgamesh is therefore in all probability a foreigner; and the simplest solution suggested by the existence of the two forms (1) Gish in the old Babylonian version and (2) Gish-g(n)-mash in the Assyrian version, is to regard the former as an abbreviation, which seemed appropriate, because the short name conveyed the idea of the "hero" _par excellence_. If Gish-g(n)-mash is a foreign name, one would think in the first instance of Sumerian; but here we encounter a difficulty in the circumstance that outside of the Epic this conqueror and ruler of Erech appears in quite a different form, namely, as dGish-bil-ga-mesh, with dGish-gibil(or bl)-ga-mesh and dGish-bil-ge-mesh as variants. [48] In the remarkable list of partly mythological and partly historical dynasties, published by Poebel, [49] the fifth member of the first dynasty of Erech appears as dGish-bil-ga-mesh; and similarly in an inscription of the days of Sin-gamil, dGish-bil-ga-mesh is mentioned as the builder of the wall of Erech. [50] Moreover, in the several fragments of the Sumerian version of the Epic we have invariably the form dGish-bil-ga-mesh. It is evident, therefore, that this is the genuine form of the name in Sumerian and presumably, therefore, the oldest form. By way of further confirmation we have in the syllabary above referred to, CT, XVIII, 30, 6-8, three designations of our hero, viz:
        dGish-gibil(or bl)-ga-mesh        _muk-tab-lu_ ("warrior")        _a-lik pa-na_ ("leader")
All three designations are set down as the equivalent of the Sumerian Esigga imin i.e., "the seven-fold hero."
Of the same general character is the equation in another syllabary: [51]
        Esigga-tuk and its equivalent Gish-tuk = "the one who is        a hero."
Furthermore, the name occurs frequently in "Temple" documents of the Ur dynasty in the form dGish-bil-ga-mesh [52] with dGish-bil-gi(n)-mesh as a variant. [53] In a list of deities (_CT_ XXV, 28, K 7659) we likewise encounter dGish-gibil(or bl)-ga-mesh, and lastly in a syllabary we have the equation [54]
        dGish-gi-mas-[si?] = dGish-bil-[ga-mesh].
The variant Gish-gibil for Gish-bil may be disposed of readily, in view of the frequent confusion or interchange of the two signs Bil (Brnnow No. 4566) and Gibil or Bl (Brnnow No. 4642) which has also the value Gi (Brnnow 4641), so that we might also read Gish-gi-ga-mesh. Both signs convey the idea of "fire," "renew," etc.; both revert to the picture of flames of fire, in the one case with a bowl (or some such obiect) above it, in the other the flames issuing apparently from a torch. [55] The meaning of the name is not affected whether we read dGish-bil-ga-mesh or dGish-gibil(or bl)-ga-mesh, for the middle element in the latter case being identical with the fire-god, written dBil-gi and to be pronounced in the inverted form as Gibil with _-ga_ (or _ge_) as the phonetic complement; it is equivalent, therefore, to the writing bil-ga in the former case. Now Gish-gibil or Gish-bl conveys the idea of _abu_, "father" (Brnnow No. 5713), just as Bil (Brnnow No. 4579) has this meaning, while Pa-gibil-(ga) or Pa-bl-ga is _abu abi_, "grandfather." [56] This meaning may be derived from Gibil, as also from Bl = _isatu_, "fire," then _essu_, "new," then _abu_, "father," as the renewer or creator. Gish with Bl or Gibil would, therefore, be "the father-man" or "the father-hero," i.e., again the hero _par excellence_, the original hero, just as in Hebrew and Arabic _ab_ is used in this way. [57] The syllable _ga _being a phonetic complement, the element _mesh_ is to be taken by itself and to be explained, as Poebel suggested, as "hero" (_itlu_. Brnnow No. 5967). We would thus obtain an entirely artificial combination, "man (or hero), father, hero," which would simply convey in an emphatic manner the idea of the _Ur-held_, the original hero, the father of heroes as it were--practically the same idea, therefore, as the one conveyed by Gish alone, as the hero _par excellence_. Our investigation thus leads us to a substantial identity between Gish and the longer form Gish-bil(or bl)-ga-mesh, and the former might, therefore, well be used as an abbreviation of the latter. Both the shorter and the longer forms are _descriptive epithets _based on naive folk etymology, rather than personal names, just as in the designation of our hero as  _muktablu_, the "fighter," or as _lik pna_, "the leader," or as _Esigga imin_, "the seven-fold hero," or _Esigga tuk_, "the one who is a hero," are descriptive epithets, and as Atra-hasis, "the very wise one," is such an epithet for the hero of the deluge story. The case is different with Gi-il-ga-mesh, or Gish-g(n)-mash, which represent the popular and actual pronunciation of the name, or at least the _approach_ to such
pronunciation. Such forms, stripped as they are of all artificiality, impress one as genuine names. The conclusion to which we are thus led is that Gish-bil(or bl)-ga-mesh is a play upon the genuine name, to convey to those to whom the real name, as that of a foreigner, would suggest no meaning an interpretation _fitting in with his character_. In other words, Gish-bil-ga-mesh is a "Sumerianized" form of the name, introduced into the Sumerian version of the tale which became a folk-possession in the Euphrates Valley. Such plays upon names to suggest the character of an individual or some incident are familiar to us from the narratives in Genesis. [58] They do not constitute genuine etymologies and are rarely of use in leading to a correct etymology. Reuben, e.g., certainly does not mean "Yahweh has seen my affliction," which the mother is supposed to have exclaimed at the birth (Genesis 29, 32), with a play upon _ben_ and _be'onyi_, any more than Judah means "I praise Yahweh" (v. 35), though it does contain the divine name (_Ye_h) as an element. The play on the name may be close or remote, as long as it fulfills its function of _suggesting_ an etymology that is complimentary or appropriate. In this way, an artificial division and at the same time a distortion of a foreign name like Gilgamesh into several elements, Gish-bil-ga-mesh, is no more violent than, for example, the explanation of Issachar or rather Issaschar as "God has given my hire" (Genesis 30, 18) with a play upon the element _se_char, and as though the name were to be divided into _Yah_ ("God") and _se_char ("hire"); or the popular name of Alexander among the Arabs as _Zu'l Karnaini_, "the possessor of the two horns." with a suggestion of his conquest of two hemispheres, or what not. [59] The element Gil in Gilgamesh would be regarded as a contraction of Gish-bil or gi-bil, in order to furnish the meaning "father-hero," or Gil might be looked upon as a variant for Gish, which would give us the "phonetic" form in the Assyrian version dGish-gi-mash, [60] as well as such a variant writing dGish-gi-mas-(si). Now a name like Gilgamesh, upon which we may definitely settle as coming closest to the genuine form, certainly impresses one as foreign, i.e., it is neither Sumerian nor Akkadian; and we have already suggested that the circumstance that the hero of the Epic is portrayed as a conqueror of Erech, and a rather ruthless one at that, points to a tradition of an invasion of the Euphrates Valley as the background for the episode in the first tablet of the series. Now it is significant that many of the names in the "mythical" dynasties, as they appear in Poebel's list, [61] are likewise foreign, such as Mes-ki-in-ga-se-ir, son of the god Shamash (and the founder of the "mythical" dynasty of Erech of which dGish-bil-ga-mesh is the fifth member), [62] and En-me-ir-kr his son. In a still earlier "mythical" dynasty, we encounter names like Ga-lu-mu-um, Zu-ga-gi-ib, Ar-pi, E-ta-na, [63] which are distinctly foreign, while such names as En-me(n)-nun-na and Bar-sal-nun-na strike one again as "Sumerianized" names rather than as genuine Sumerian formations. [64] Some of these names, as Galumum, Arpi and Etana, are so Amoritic in appearance, that one may hazard the conjecture of their western origin. May Gilgamesh likewise belong to the Amurru [65] region, or does he represent a foreigner from the East in contrast to Enkidu, whose name, we have seen, may have been Baal-Tb in the West, with which region he is according to the Epic so familiar? It must be confessed that the second element _ga-mesh_ would fit in well with a Semitic origin for the name, for the element impresses one as the participial form of a Semitic stem G-M-S, just as in the second element of Meskin-gaser we have such a form. Gil might then be the
name of a West-Semitic deity. Such conjectures, however, can for the present not be substantiated, and we must content ourselves with the conclusion that Gilgamesh as the real name of the hero, or at least the form which comes closest to the real name, points to a foreign origin for the hero, and that such forms as dGish-bil-ga-mesh and dGish-bl-gi-mesh and other variants are "Sumerianized" forms for which an artificial etymology was brought forward to convey the idea of the "original hero" or the hero _par excellence_. By means of this "play" on the name, which reverts to the compilers of the Sumerian version of the Epic, Gilgamesh was converted into a Sumerian figure, just as the name Enkidu may have been introduced as a Sumerian translation of his Amoritic name. dGish at all events is an abbreviated form of the "Sumerianized" name, introduced by the compilers of the earliest Akkadian version, which was produced naturally under the influence of the Sumerian version. Later, as the Epic continued to grow, a phonetic writing was introduced, dGish-gi-mash, which is in a measure a compromise between the genuine name and the "Sumerianized" form, but at the same time an _approach_ to the real pronunciation.
VI.
Next to the new light thrown upon the names and original character of the two main figures of the Epic, one of the chief points of interest in the Pennsylvania fragment is the proof that it furnishes for a striking resemblance of the two heroes, Gish and Enkidu, to one another. In interpreting the dream of Gish, his mother. Ninsun, lays stress upon the fact that the dream portends the coming of someone who is like Gish, "born in the field and reared in the mountain" (lines 18-19). Both, therefore, are shown by this description to have come to Babylonia from a mountainous region, i.e., they are foreigners; and in the case of Enkidu we have seen that the mountain in all probability refers to a region in the West, while the same may also be the case with Gish. The resemblance of the two heroes to one another extends to their personal appearance. When Enkidu appears on the streets of Erech, the people are struck by this resemblance. They remark that he is "like Gish," though "shorter in stature" (lines 179-180). Enkidu is described as a rival or counterpart. [66] This relationship between the two is suggested also by the Assyrian version. In the creation of Enkidu by Aruru, the people urge the goddess to create the "counterpart" (_zikru_) of Gilgamesh, someone who will be like him (_ma-si-il_) (Tablet I, 2, 31). Enkidu not only comes from the mountain, [67] but the mountain is specifically designated as his birth-place (I, 4, 2), precisely as in the Pennsylvania tablet, while in another passage he is also described, as in our tablet, as "born in the field." [68] Still more significant is the designation of Gilgamesh as the _talimu_, "younger brother," of Enkidu. [69] In accord with this, we find Gilgamesh in his lament over Enkidu describing him as a "younger brother" (_ku-ta-ni_); [70] and again in the last tablet of the Epic, Gilgamesh is referred to as the "brother" of Enkidu. [71] This close relationship reverts to the Sumerian version, for the Constantinople fragment (Langdon, above, p. 13) begins with the designation of Gish-bil-ga-mesh as "his brother." By "his" no doubt Enkidu is meant. Likewise in the Sumerian text published by Zimmern (above, p. 13) Gilgamesh appears as the brother of Enkidu (rev. 1, 17).
Turning to the numerous representations of Gilgamesh and Enkidu on Seal Cylinders, [72] we find this resemblance of the two heroes to each other strikingly confirmed. Both are represented as bearded, with the strands arranged in the same fashion. The face in both cases is broad, with curls protruding at the side of the head, though at times these curls are lacking in the case of Enkidu. What is particularly striking is to find Gilgamesh generally _a little taller_ than Enkidu, thus bearing out the statement in the Pennsylvania tablet that Enkidu is "shorter in stature." There are, to be sure, also some distinguishing marks between the two. Thus Enkidu is generally represented with animal hoofs, but not always. [73] Enkidu is commonly portrayed with the horns of a bison, but again this sign is wanting in quite a number of instances. [74] The hoofs and the horns mark the period when Enkidu lived with animals and much like an animal. Most remarkable, however, of all are cylinders on which we find the two heroes almost exactly alike as, for example, Ward No. 199 where two figures, the one a duplicate of the other (except that one is just a shade taller), are in conflict with each other. Dr. Ward was puzzled by this representation and sets it down as a "fantastic" scene in which "each Gilgamesh is stabbing the other." In the light of the Pennsylvania tablet, this scene is clearly the conflict between the two heroes described in column 6, preliminary to their forming a friendship. Even in the realm of myth the human experience holds good that there is nothing like a good fight as a basis for a subsequent alliance. The fragment describes this conflict as a furious one in which Gilgamesh is worsted, and his wounded pride assuaged by the generous victor, who comforts his vanquished enemy by the assurance that he was destined for something higher than to be a mere "Hercules." He was singled out for the exercise of royal authority. True to the description of the two heroes in the Pennsylvania tablet as alike, one the counterpart of the other, the seal cylinder portrays them almost exactly alike, as alike as two brothers could possibly be; with just enough distinction to make it clear on close inspection that two figures are intended and not one repeated for the sake of symmetry. There are slight variations in the manner in which the hair is worn, and slightly varying expressions of the face, just enough to make it evident that the one is intended for Gilgamesh and the other for Enkidu. When, therefore, in another specimen, No. 173, we find a Gilgamesh holding his counterpart by the legs, it is merely another aspect of the fight between the two heroes, one of whom is intended to represent Enkidu, and not, as Dr. Ward supposed, a grotesque repetition of Gilgamesh. [75] The description of Enkidu in the Pennsylvania tablet as a parallel figure to Gilgamesh leads us to a consideration of the relationship of the two figures to one another. Many years ago it was pointed out that the Gilgamesh Epic was a composite tale in which various stories of an independent origin had been combined and brought into more or less artificial connection with the _heros eponymos_ of southern Babylonia. [76] We may now go a step further and point out that not only is Enkidu originally an entirely independent figure, having no connection with Gish or Gilgamesh, but that the latter is really depicted in the Epic as the counterpart of Enkidu, a reflection who has been given the traits of extraordinary physical power that belong to Enkidu. This is shown in the first place by the fact that in the encounter it is Enkidu who triumphs over Gilgamesh. The entire analysis of the episode of the meeting between the two heroes as given by Gressmann [77] must be revised. It is not Enkidu who is terrified and who is warned against the encounter. It is Gilgamesh who, during the night on his way from the house in which the goddess Ishhara
lies, encounters Enkidu on the highway. Enkidu "blocks the path" [78] of Gilgamesh. He prevents Gilgamesh from re-entering the house, [79] and the two attack each other "like oxen." [80] They grapple with each other, and Enkidu forces Gilgamesh to the ground. Enkidu is, therefore, the real hero whose traits of physical prowess are afterwards transferred to Gilgamesh. Similarly in the next episode, the struggle against Huwawa, the Yale tablet makes it clear that in the original form of the tale Enkidu is the real hero. All warn Gish against the undertaking--the elders of Erech, Enkidu, and also the workmen. "Why dost thou desire to do this?" [81] they say to him. "Thou art young, and thy heart carries thee away. Thou knowest not what thou proposest to do." [82] This part of the incident is now better known to us through the latest fragment of the Assyrian version discovered and published by King. [83] The elders say to Gilgamesh:
        "Do not trust, O Gilgamesh, in thy strength!        Be warned(?) against trusting to thy attack!        The one who goes before will save his companion, [84]        He who has foresight will save his friend. [85]        Let Enkidu go before thee.        He knows the roads to the cedar forest;        He is skilled in battle and has seen fight."
Gilgamesh is sufficiently impressed by this warning to invite Enkidu to accompany him on a visit to his mother, Ninsun, for the purpose of receiving her counsel. [86] It is only after Enkidu, who himself hesitates and tries to dissuade Gish, decides to accompany the latter that the elders of Erech are reconciled and encourage Gish for the fray. The two in concert proceed against Huwawa. Gilgamesh alone cannot carry out the plan. Now when a tale thus associates two figures in one deed, one of the two has been added to the original tale. In the present case there can be little doubt that Enkidu, without whom Gish cannot proceed, who is specifically described as "acquainted with the way ... to the entrance of the forest" [87] in which Huwawa dwells is the _original_ vanquisher. Naturally, the Epic aims to conceal this fact as much as possible _ad majorem gloriam_ of Gilgamesh. It tries to put the one who became the favorite hero into the foreground. Therefore, in both the Babylonian and the Assyrian version Enkidu is represented as hesitating, and Gilgamesh as determined to go ahead. Gilgamesh, in fact, accuses Enkidu of cowardice and boldly declares that he will proceed even though failure stare him in the face. [88] Traces of the older view, however, in which Gilgamesh is the one for whom one fears the outcome, crop out; as, for example, in the complaint of Gilgamesh's mother to Shamash that the latter has stirred the heart of her son to take the distant way to Hu(m)baba,
        "To a fight unknown to him, he advances,        An expedition unknown to him he undertakes." [89]
Ninsun evidently fears the consequences when her son informs her of his intention and asks her counsel. The answer of Shamash is not
preserved, but no doubt it was of a reassuring character, as was the answer of the Sun-god to Gish's appeal and prayer as set forth in the Yale tablet. [90] Again, as a further indication that Enkidu is the real conqueror of Huwawa, we find the coming contest revealed to Enkidu no less than three times in dreams, which Gilgamesh interprets. [91] Since the person who dreams is always the one to whom the dream applies, we may see in these dreams a further trace of the primary rle originally assigned to Enkidu. Another exploit which, according to the Assyrian version, the two heroes perform in concert is the killing of a bull, sent by Anu at the instance of Ishtar to avenge an insult offered to the goddess by Gilgamesh, who rejects her offer of marriage. In the fragmentary description of the contest with the bull, we find Enkidu "seizing" the monster by "its tail." [92] That Enkidu originally played the part of the slayer is also shown by the statement that it is he who insults Ishtar by throwing a piece of the carcass into the goddess' face, [93] adding also an insulting speech; and this despite the fact that Ishtar in her rage accuses Gilgamesh of killing the bull. [94] It is thus evident that the Epic alters the original character of the episodes in order to find a place for Gilgamesh, with the further desire to assign to the latter the _chief_ rle. Be it noted also that Enkidu, not Gilgamesh, is punished for the insult to Ishtar. Enkidu must therefore in the original form of the episode have been the guilty party, who is stricken with mortal disease as a punishment to which after twelve days he succumbs. [95] In view of this, we may supply the name of Enkidu in the little song introduced at the close of the encounter with the bull, and not Gilgamesh as has hitherto been done.
        "Who is distinguished among the heroes?        Who is glorious among men?        [Enkidu] is distinguished among heroes,        [Enkidu] is glorious among men." [96]
Finally, the killing of lions is directly ascribed to Enkidu in the Pennsylvania tablet:
        "Lions he attacked        *     *     *     *     *        Lions he overcame" [97]
whereas Gilgamesh appears to be afraid of lions. On his long search for Utnapishtim he says:
        "On reaching the entrance of the mountain at night        I saw lions and was afraid." [98]
He prays to Sin and Ishtar to protect and save him. When, therefore, in another passage some one celebrates Gilgamesh as the one who
overcame the "guardian," who dispatched Hu(m)baba in the cedar forest, who killed lions and overthrew the bull, [99] we have the completion of the process which transferred to Gilgamesh exploits and powers which originally belonged to Enkidu, though ordinarily the process stops short at making Gilgamesh a _sharer_ in the exploits; with the natural tendency, to be sure, to enlarge the share of the favorite. We can now understand why the two heroes are described in the Pennsylvania tablet as alike, as born in the same place, aye, as brothers. Gilgamesh in the Epic is merely a reflex of Enkidu. The latter is the real hero and presumably, therefore, the older figure. [100] Gilgamesh resembles Enkidu, because he _is_ originally Enkidu. The "resemblance" _motif_ is merely the manner in which in the course of the partly popular, partly literary transfer, the recollection is preserved that Enkidu is the original, and Gilgamesh the copy. The artificiality of the process which brings the two heroes together is apparent in the dreams of Gilgamesh which are interpreted by his mother as portending the coming of Enkidu. Not the conflict is foreseen, but the subsequent close association, navely described as due to the personal charm which Enkidu exercises, which will lead Gilgamesh to fall in love with the one whom he is to meet. The two will become one, like man and wife. On the basis of our investigations, we are now in a position to reconstruct in part the cycle of episodes that once formed part of an Enkidu Epic. The fight between Enkidu and Gilgamesh, in which the former is the victor, is typical of the kind of tales told of Enkidu. He is the real prototype of the Greek Hercules. He slays lions, he overcomes a powerful opponent dwelling in the forests of Lebanon, he kills the bull, and he finally succumbs to disease sent as a punishment by an angry goddess. The death of Enkidu naturally formed the close of the Enkidu Epic, which in its original form may, of course, have included other exploits besides those taken over into the Gilgamesh Epic.
VII.
There is another aspect of the figure of Enkidu which is brought forward in the Pennsylvania tablet more clearly than had hitherto been the case. Many years ago attention was called to certain striking resemblances between Enkidu and the figure of the first man as described in the early chapters of Genesis. [101] At that time we had merely the Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh Epic at our disposal, and the main point of contact was the description of Enkidu living with the animals, drinking and feeding like an animal, until a woman is brought to him with whom he engages in sexual intercourse. This suggested that Enkidu was a picture of primeval man, while the woman reminded one of Eve, who when she is brought to Adam becomes his helpmate and inseparable companion. The Biblical tale stands, of course, on a much higher level, and is introduced, as are other traditions and tales of primitive times, in the style of a parable to convey certain religious teachings. For all that, suggestions of earlier conceptions crop out in the picture of Adam surrounded by animals to which he assigns names. Such a phrase as "there was no
helpmate corresponding to him" becomes intelligible on the supposition of an existing tradition or belief, that man once lived and, indeed, cohabited with animals. The tales in the early chapters of Genesis must rest on very early popular traditions, which have been cleared of mythological and other objectionable features in order to adapt them to the purpose of the Hebrew compilers, to serve as a medium for illustrating certain religious teachings regarding man's place in nature and his higher destiny. From the resemblance between Enkidu and Adam it does not, of course, follow that the latter is modelled upon the former, but only that both rest on similar traditions of the condition under which men lived in primeval days prior to the beginnings of human culture. We may now pass beyond these general indications and recognize in the story of Enkidu as revealed by the Pennsylvania tablet an attempt to trace the evolution of primitive man from low beginnings to the regular and orderly family life associated with advanced culture. The new tablet furnishes a further illustration for the surprisingly early tendency among the Babylonian _literati_ to connect with popular tales teachings of a religious or ethical character. Just as the episode between Gilgamesh and the maiden Sabitum is made the occasion for introducing reflections on the inevitable fate of man to encounter death, so the meeting of Enkidu with the woman becomes the medium of impressing the lesson of human progress through the substitution of bread and wine for milk and water, through the institution of the family, and through work and the laying up of resources. This is the significance of the address to Enkidu in column 4 of the Pennsylvania tablet, even though certain expressions in it are somewhat obscure. The connection of the entire episode of Enkidu and the woman with Gilgamesh is very artificial; and it becomes much more intelligible if we disassociate it from its present entanglement in the Epic. In Gilgamesh's dream, portending the meeting with Enkidu, nothing is said of the woman who is the companion of the latter. The passage in which Enkidu is created by Aruru to oppose Gilgamesh [102] betrays evidence of having been worked over in order to bring Enkidu into association with the longing of the people of Erech to get rid of a tyrannical character. The people in their distress appeal to Aruru to create a rival to Gilgamesh. In response,
        "Aruru upon hearing this created a man of Anu in her heart."
Now this "man of Anu" cannot possibly be Enkidu, for the sufficient reason that a few lines further on Enkidu is described as an offspring of Ninib. Moreover, the being created is not a "counterpart" of Gilgamesh, but an animal-man, as the description that follows shows. We must separate lines 30-33 in which the creation of the "Anu man" is described from lines 34-41 in which the creation of Enkidu is narrated. Indeed, these lines strike one as the proper _beginning_ of the original Enkidu story, which would naturally start out with his birth and end with his death. The description is clearly an account of the creation of the first man, in which capacity Enkidu is brought forward.
        "Aruru washed her hands, broke off clay,        threw it on the field [103]        ... created Enkidu, the hero, a lofty
        offspring of the host of Ninib." [104]
The description of Enkidu follows, with his body covered with hair like an animal, and eating and drinking with the animals. There follows an episode [105] which has no connection whatsoever with the Gilgamesh Epic, but which is clearly intended to illustrate how Enkidu came to abandon the life with the animals. A hunter sees Enkidu and is amazed at the strange sight--an animal and yet a man. Enkidu, as though resenting his condition, becomes enraged at the sight of the hunter, and the latter goes to his father and tells him of the strange creature whom he is unable to catch. In reply, the father advises his son to take a woman with him when next he goes out on his pursuit, and to have the woman remove her dress in the presence of Enkidu, who will then approach her, and after intercourse with her will abandon the animals among whom he lives. By this device he will catch the strange creature. Lines 14-18 of column 3 in the first tablet in which the father of the hunter refers to Gilgamesh must be regarded as a later insertion, a part of the reconstruction of the tale to connect the episode with Gilgamesh. The advice of the father to his son, the hunter, begins, line 19,
        "Go my hunter, take with thee a woman."
In the reconstructed tale, the father tells his son to go to Gilgamesh to relate to him the strange appearance of the animal-man; but there is clearly no purpose in this, as is shown by the fact that when the hunter does so, Gilgamesh makes _precisely the same speech_ as does the father of the hunter. Lines 40-44 of column 3, in which Gilgamesh is represented as speaking to the hunter form a complete _doublet_ to lines 19-24, beginning
        "Go, my hunter, take with thee a woman, etc."
and similarly the description of Enkidu appears twice, lines 2-12 in an address of the hunter to his father, and lines 29-39 in the address of the hunter to Gilgamesh. The artificiality of the process of introducing Gilgamesh into the episode is revealed by this awkward and entirely meaningless repetition. We may therefore reconstruct the first two scenes in the Enkidu Epic as follows: [106] Tablet I, col. 2, 34-35: Creation of Enkidu by Aruru. 36-41: Description of Enkidu's hairy body and of his life with the animals. 42-50: The hunter sees Enkidu, who shows his anger, as also his woe, at his condition. 3, 1-12: The hunter tells his father of the strange being who pulls up the traps which the hunter digs, and who tears the nets so that the hunter is unable to catch him or the animals.
19-24: The father of the hunter advises his son on his next expedition to take a woman with him in order to lure the strange being from his life with the animals. Line 25, beginning "On the advice of his father," must have set forth, in the original form of the episode, how the hunter procured the woman and took her with him to meet Enkidu. Column 4 gives in detail the meeting between the two, and navely describes how the woman exposes her charms to Enkidu, who is captivated by her and stays with her six days and seven nights. The animals see the change in Enkidu and run away from him. He has been transformed through the woman. So far the episode. In the Assyrian version there follows an address of the woman to Enkidu beginning (col. 4, 34):
        "Beautiful art thou, Enkidu, like a god art thou."
We find her urging him to go with her to Erech, there to meet Gilgamesh and to enjoy the pleasures of city life with plenty of beautiful maidens. Gilgamesh, she adds, will expect Enkidu, for the coming of the latter to Erech has been foretold in a dream. It is evident that here we have again the later transformation of the Enkidu Epic in order to bring the two heroes together. Will it be considered too bold if we assume that in the original form the address of the woman and the construction of the episode were such as we find preserved in part in columns 2 to 4 of the Pennsylvania tablet, which forms part of the new material that can now be added to the Epic? The address of the woman begins in line 51 of the Pennsylvania tablet:
        "I gaze upon thee, Enkidu, like a god art thou."
This corresponds to the line in the Assyrian version (I, 4, 34) as given above, just as lines 52-53:
        "Why with the cattle        Dost thou roam across the field?"
correspond to I, 4, 35, of the Assyrian version. There follows in both the old Babylonian and the Assyrian version the appeal of the woman to Enkidu, to allow her to lead him to Erech where Gilgamesh dwells (Pennsylvania tablet lines 54-61 = Assyrian version I, 4, 36-39); but in the Pennsylvania tablet we now have a _second_ speech (lines 62-63) beginning like the first one with _al-ka_, "come:"
        "Come, arise from the accursed ground."
Enkidu consents, and now the woman takes off her garments and clothes the naked Enkidu, while putting another garment on herself. She takes hold of his hand and leads him to the sheepfolds (not to Erech!!), where bread and wine are placed before him. Accustomed hitherto to sucking milk with cattle, Enkidu does not know what to do with
the strange food until encouraged and instructed by the woman. The entire third column is taken up with this introduction of Enkidu to civilized life in a pastoral community, and the scene ends with Enkidu becoming a guardian of flocks. Now all this has nothing to do with Gilgamesh, and clearly sets forth an entirely different idea from the one embodied in the meeting of the two heroes. In the original Enkidu tale, the animal-man is looked upon as the type of a primitive savage, and the point of the tale is to illustrate in the nave manner characteristic of folklore the evolution to the higher form of pastoral life. This aspect of the incident is, therefore, to be separated from the other phase which has as its chief _motif_ the bringing of the two heroes together. We now obtain, thanks to the new section revealed by the Pennsylvania tablet, a further analogy [107] with the story of Adam and Eve, but with this striking difference, that whereas in the Babylonian tale the woman is the medium leading man to the higher life, in the Biblical story the woman is the tempter who brings misfortune to man. This contrast is, however, not inherent in the Biblical story, but due to the point of view of the Biblical writer, who is somewhat pessimistically inclined and looks upon primitive life, when man went naked and lived in a garden, eating of fruits that grew of themselves, as the blessed life in contrast to advanced culture which leads to agriculture and necessitates hard work as the means of securing one's substance. Hence the woman through whom Adam eats of the tree of knowledge and becomes conscious of being naked is looked upon as an evil tempter, entailing the loss of the primeval life of bliss in a gorgeous Paradise. The Babylonian point of view is optimistic. The change to civilized life--involving the wearing of clothes and the eating of food that is cultivated (bread and wine) is looked upon as an advance. Hence the woman is viewed as the medium of raising man to a higher level. The feature common to the Biblical and Babylonian tales is the attachment of a lesson to early folk-tales. The story of Adam and Eve, [108] as the story of Enkidu and the woman, is told _with a purpose_. Starting with early traditions of men's primitive life on earth, that may have arisen independently, Hebrew and Babylonian writers diverged, each group going its own way, each reflecting the particular point of view from which the evolution of human society was viewed. Leaving the analogy between the Biblical and Babylonian tales aside, the main point of value for us in the Babylonian story of Enkidu and the woman is the proof furnished by the analysis, made possible through the Pennsylvania tablet, that the tale can be separated from its subsequent connection with Gilgamesh. We can continue this process of separation in the fourth column, where the woman instructs Enkidu in the further duty of living his life with the woman decreed for him, to raise a family, to engage in work, to build cities and to gather resources. All this is looked upon in the same optimistic spirit as marking progress, whereas the Biblical writer, consistent with his point of view, looks upon work as a curse, and makes Cain, the murderer, also the founder of cities. The step to the higher forms of life is not an advance according to the J document. It is interesting to note that even the phrase the "cursed ground" occurs in both the Babylonian and Biblical tales; but whereas in the latter (Gen. 3, 17) it is because of the hard work entailed in raising the products of the earth that the ground is cursed, in the former (lines 62-63) it is the place in which Enkidu lives _before_ he advances to the dignity of human life that is "cursed," and which he is asked
to leave. Adam is expelled from Paradise as a punishment, whereas Enkidu is implored to leave it as a necessary step towards _progress_ to a higher form of existence. The contrast between the Babylonian and the Biblical writer extends to the view taken of viniculture. The Biblical writer (again the J document) looks upon Noah's drunkenness as a disgrace. Noah loses his sense of shame and uncovers himself (Genesis 9, 21), whereas in the Babylonian description Enkidu's jolly spirit after he has drunk seven jars of wine meets with approval. The Biblical point of view is that he who drinks wine becomes drunk; [109] the Babylonian says, if you drink wine you become happy. [110] If the thesis here set forth of the original character and import of the episode of Enkidu with the woman is correct, we may again regard lines 149-153 of the Pennsylvania tablet, in which Gilgamesh is introduced, as a later addition to bring the two heroes into association. The episode in its original form ended with the introduction of Enkidu first to pastoral life, and then to the still higher city life with regulated forms of social existence. Now, to be sure, this Enkidu has little in common with the Enkidu who is described as a powerful warrior, a Hercules, who kills lions, overcomes the giant Huwawa, and dispatches a great bull, but it is the nature of folklore everywhere to attach to traditions about a favorite hero all kinds of tales with which originally he had nothing to do. Enkidu, as such a favorite, is viewed also as the type of primitive man, [111] and so there arose gradually an Epic which began with his birth, pictured him as half-animal half-man, told how he emerged from this state, how he became civilized, was clothed, learned to eat food and drink wine, how he shaved off the hair with which his body was covered, [112] anointed himself--in short,
        "He became manlike." [113]
Thereupon he is taught his duties as a husband, is introduced to the work of building, and to laying aside supplies, and the like. The fully-developed and full-fledged hero then engages in various exploits, of which _some_ are now embodied in the Gilgamesh Epic. Who this Enkidu was, we are not in a position to determine, but the suggestion has been thrown out above that he is a personage foreign to Babylonia, that his home appears to be in the undefined Amurru district, and that he conquers that district. The original tale of Enkidu, if this view be correct, must therefore have been carried to the Euphrates Valley, at a very remote period, with one of the migratory waves that brought a western people as invaders into Babylonia. Here the tale was combined with stories current of another hero, Gilgamesh--perhaps also of Western origin--whose conquest of Erech likewise represents an invasion of Babylonia. The center of the Gilgamesh tale was Erech, and in the process of combining the stories of Enkidu and Gilgamesh, Enkidu is brought to Erech and the two perform exploits in common. In such a combination, the aim would be to utilize all the incidents of _both_ tales. The woman who accompanies Enkidu, therefore, becomes the medium of bringing the two heroes together. The story of the evolution of primitive man to civilized life is transformed into the tale of Enkidu's removal to Erech, and elaborated with all kinds of details, among which we have, as perhaps embodying a genuine historical tradition, the encounter of the two heroes.
Before passing on, we have merely to note the very large part taken in both the old Babylonian and the Assyrian version by the struggle against Huwawa. The entire Yale tablet--forming, as we have seen, the third of the series--is taken up with the preparation for the struggle, and with the repeated warnings given to Gilgamesh against the dangerous undertaking. The fourth tablet must have recounted the struggle itself, and it is not improbable that this episode extended into the fifth tablet, since in the Assyrian version this is the case. The elaboration of the story is in itself an argument in favor of assuming some historical background for it--the recollection of the conquest of Amurru by some powerful warrior; and we have seen that this conquest must be ascribed to Enkidu and not to Gilgamesh.
VIII.
If, now, Enkidu is not only the older figure but the one who is the real hero of the most notable episode in the Gilgamesh Epic; if, furthermore, Enkidu is the Hercules who kills lions and dispatches the bull sent by an enraged goddess, what becomes of Gilgamesh? What is left for him? In the first place, he is definitely the conqueror of Erech. He builds the wall of Erech, [114] and we may assume that the designation of the city as _Uruk supri_, "the walled Erech," [115] rests upon this tradition. He is also associated with the great temple Eanna, "the heavenly house," in Erech. To Gilgamesh belongs also the unenviable tradition of having exercised his rule in Erech so harshly that the people are impelled to implore Aruru to create a rival who may rid the district of the cruel tyrant, who is described as snatching sons and daughters from their families, and in other ways terrifying the population--an early example of "Schrecklichkeit." Tablets II to V inclusive of the Assyrian version being taken up with the Huwawa episode, modified with a view of bringing the two heroes together, we come at once to the sixth tablet, which tells the story of how the goddess Ishtar wooed Gilgamesh, and of the latter's rejection of her advances. This tale is distinctly a nature myth. The attempt of Gressmann [116] to find some historical background to the episode is a failure. The goddess Ishtar symbolizes the earth which woos the sun in the spring, but whose love is fatal, for after a few months the sun's power begins to wane. Gilgamesh, who in incantation hymns is invoked in terms which show that he was conceived as a sun-god, [117] recalls to the goddess how she changed her lovers into animals, like Circe of Greek mythology, and brought them to grief. Enraged at Gilgamesh's insult to her vanity, she flies to her father Anu and cries for revenge. At this point the episode of the creation of the bull is introduced, but if the analysis above given is correct it is Enkidu who is the hero in dispatching the bull, and we must assume that the sickness with which Gilgamesh is smitten is the punishment sent by Anu to avenge the insult to his daughter. This sickness symbolizes the waning strength of the sun after midsummer is past. The sun recedes from the earth, and this was pictured in the myth as the sun-god's rejection of Ishtar; Gilgamesh's fear of death marks the approach of the winter season, when the sun appears to have lost its vigor completely and is near to death. The entire episode is, therefore, a nature myth, symbolical of the passing of spring to midsummer and then to the bare season. The myth has been attached to Gilgamesh as
a favorite figure, and then woven into a pattern with the episode of Enkidu and the bull. The bull episode can be detached from the nature myth without any loss to the symbolism of the tale of Ishtar and Gilgamesh. As already suggested, with Enkidu's death after this conquest of the bull the original Enkidu Epic came to an end. In order to connect Gilgamesh with Enkidu, the former is represented as sharing in the struggle against the bull. Enkidu is punished with death, while Gilgamesh is smitten with disease. Since both shared equally in the guilt, the punishment should have been the same for both. The differentiation may be taken as an indication that Gilgamesh's disease has nothing to do with the bull episode, but is merely part of the nature myth. Gilgamesh now begins a series of wanderings in search of the restoration of his vigor, and this _motif_ is evidently a continuation of the nature myth to symbolize the sun's wanderings during the dark winter in the hope of renewed vigor with the coming of the spring. Professor Haupt's view is that the disease from which Gilgamesh is supposed to be suffering is of a venereal character, affecting the organs of reproduction. This would confirm the position here taken that the myth symbolizes the loss of the sun's vigor. The sun's rays are no longer strong enough to fertilize the earth. In accord with this, Gilgamesh's search for healing leads him to the dark regions [118] in which the scorpion-men dwell. The terrors of the region symbolize the gloom of the winter season. At last Gilgamesh reaches a region of light again, described as a landscape situated at the sea. The maiden in control of this region bolts the gate against Gilgamesh's approach, but the latter forces his entrance. It is the picture of the sun-god bursting through the darkness, to emerge as the youthful reinvigorated sun-god of the spring. Now with the tendency to attach to popular tales and nature myths lessons illustrative of current beliefs and aspirations, Gilgamesh's search for renewal of life is viewed as man's longing for eternal life. The sun-god's waning power after midsummer is past suggests man's growing weakness after the meridian of life has been left behind. Winter is death, and man longs to escape it. Gilgamesh's wanderings are used as illustration of this longing, and accordingly the search for life becomes also the quest for immortality. Can the precious boon of eternal life be achieved? Popular fancy created the figure of a favorite of the gods who had escaped a destructive deluge in which all mankind had perished. [119] Gilgamesh hears of this favorite and determines to seek him out and learn from him the secret of eternal life. The deluge story, again a pure nature myth, symbolical of the rainy season which destroys all life in nature, is thus attached to the Epic. Gilgamesh after many adventures finds himself in the presence of the survivor of the Deluge who, although human, enjoys immortal life among the gods. He asks the survivor how he came to escape the common fate of mankind, and in reply Utnapishtim tells the story of the catastrophe that brought about universal destruction. The moral of the tale is obvious. Only those singled out by the special favor of the gods can hope to be removed to the distant "source of the streams" and live forever. The rest of mankind must face death as the end of life. That the story of the Deluge is told in the eleventh tablet of the series, corresponding to the eleventh month, known as the month of
"rain curse" [120] and marking the height of the rainy season, may be intentional, just as it may not be accidental that Gilgamesh's rejection of Ishtar is recounted in the sixth tablet, corresponding to the sixth month, [121] which marks the end of the summer season. The two tales may have formed part of a cycle of myths, distributed among the months of the year. The Gilgamesh Epic, however, does not form such a cycle. Both myths have been artificially attached to the adventures of the hero. For the deluge story we now have the definite proof for its independent existence, through Dr. Poebel's publication of a Sumerian text which embodies the tale, [122] and without any reference to Gilgamesh. Similarly, Scheil and Hilprecht have published fragments of deluge stories written in Akkadian and likewise without any connection with the Gilgamesh Epic. [123] In the Epic the story leads to another episode attached to Gilgamesh, namely, the search for a magic plant growing in deep water, which has the power of restoring old age to youth. Utnapishtim, the survivor of the deluge, is moved through pity for Gilgamesh, worn out by his long wanderings. At the request of his wife, Utnapishtim decides to tell Gilgamesh of this plant, and he succeeds in finding it. He plucks it and decides to take it back to Erech so that all may enjoy the benefit, but on his way stops to bathe in a cool cistern. A serpent comes along and snatches the plant from him, and he is forced to return to Erech with his purpose unachieved. Man cannot hope, when old age comes on, to escape death as the end of everything. Lastly, the twelfth tablet of the Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh Epic is of a purely didactic character, bearing evidence of having been added as a further illustration of the current belief that there is no escape from the nether world to which all must go after life has come to an end. Proper burial and suitable care of the dead represent all that can be done in order to secure a fairly comfortable rest for those who have passed out of this world. Enkidu is once more introduced into this episode. His shade is invoked by Gilgamesh and rises up out of the lower world to give a discouraging reply to Gilgamesh's request,
        "Tell me, my friend, tell me, my friend,        The law of the earth which thou hast        experienced, tell me,"
The mournful message comes back:
        "I cannot tell thee, my friend, I cannot tell."
Death is a mystery and must always remain such. The historical Gilgamesh has clearly no connection with the figure introduced into this twelfth tablet. Indeed, as already suggested, the Gilgamesh Epic must have ended with the return to Erech, as related at the close of the eleventh tablet. The twelfth tablet was added by some school-men of Babylonia (or perhaps of Assyria), purely for the purpose of conveying a summary of the teachings in regard to the fate of the dead. Whether these six episodes covering the sixth to the twelfth tablets, (1) the nature myth, (2) the killing of the divine bull, (3) the punishment of Gilgamesh and the death of Enkidu, (4) Gilgamesh's wanderings, (5) the Deluge, (6) the search for immortality, were all included
at the time that the old Babylonian version was compiled cannot, of course, be determined until we have that version in a more complete form. Since the two tablets thus far recovered show that as early as 2000 B.C. the Enkidu tale had already been amalgamated with the current stories about Gilgamesh, and the endeavor made to transfer the traits of the former to the latter, it is eminently likely that the story of Ishtar's unhappy love adventure with Gilgamesh was included, as well as Gilgamesh's punishment and the death of Enkidu. With the evidence furnished by Meissner's fragment of a version of the old Babylonian revision and by our two tablets, of the early disposition to make popular tales the medium of illustrating current beliefs and the teachings of the temple schools, it may furthermore be concluded that the death of Enkidu and the punishment of Gilgamesh were utilized for didactic purposes in the old Babylonian version. On the other hand, the proof for the existence of the deluge story in the Hammurabi period and some centuries later, _independent_ of any connection with the Gilgamesh Epic, raises the question whether in the old Babylonian version, of which our two tablets form a part, the deluge tale was already woven into the pattern of the Epic. At all events, till proof to the contrary is forthcoming, we may assume that the twelfth tablet of the Assyrian version, though also reverting to a Babylonian original, dates as the _latest_ addition to the Epic from a period subsequent to 2000 B.C.; and that the same is probably the case with the eleventh tablet.
IX.
To sum up, there are four main currents that flow together in the Gilgamesh Epic even in its old Babylonian form: (1) the adventures of a mighty warrior Enkidu, resting perhaps on a faint tradition of the conquest of Amurru by the hero; (2) the more definite recollection of the exploits of a foreign invader of Babylonia by the name of Gilgamesh, whose home appears likewise to have been in the West; [124] (3) nature myths and didactic tales transferred to Enkidu and Gilgamesh as popular figures; and (4) the process of weaving the traditions, exploits, myths and didactic tales together, in the course of which process Gilgamesh becomes the main hero, and Enkidu his companion. Furthermore, our investigation has shown that to Enkidu belongs the episode with the woman, used to illustrate the evolution of primitive man to the ways and conditions of civilized life, the conquest of Huwawa in the land of Amurru, the killing of lions and also of the bull, while Gilgamesh is the hero who conquers Erech. Identified with the sun-god, the nature myth of the union of the sun with the earth and the subsequent separation of the two is also transferred to him. The wanderings of the hero, smitten with disease, are a continuation of the nature myth, symbolizing the waning vigor of the sun with the approach of the wintry season. The details of the process which led to making Gilgamesh the favorite figure, to whom the traits and exploits of Enkidu and of the sun-god are transferred, escape us, but of the fact that Enkidu is the _older_ figure, of whom certain adventures were set forth in a tale that once had an independent existence, there can now be little doubt in the face of the evidence furnished by the two tablets of the old Babylonian version; just as the study of these tablets shows that
in the combination of the tales of Enkidu and Gilgamesh, the former is the prototype of which Gilgamesh is the copy. If the two are regarded as brothers, as born in the same place, even resembling one another in appearance and carrying out their adventures in common, it is because in the process of combination Gilgamesh becomes the _reflex_ of Enkidu. That Enkidu is not the figure created by Aruru to relieve Erech of its tyrannical ruler is also shown by the fact that Gilgamesh remains in control of Erech. It is to Erech that he returns when he fails of his purpose to learn the secret of escape from old age and death. Erech is, therefore, not relieved of the presence of the ruthless ruler through Enkidu. The "Man of Anu" formed by Aruru as a deliverer is confused in the course of the growth of the Epic with Enkidu, the offspring of Ninib, and in this way we obtain the strange contradiction of Enkidu and Gilgamesh appearing first as bitter rivals and then as close and inseparable friends. It is of the nature of Epic compositions everywhere to eliminate unnecessary figures by concentrating on one favorite the traits belonging to another or to several others. The close association of Enkidu and Gilgamesh which becomes one of the striking features in the combination of the tales of these two heroes naturally recalls the "Heavenly Twins" _motif_, which has been so fully and so suggestively treated by Professor J. Rendell Harris in his _Cult of the Heavenly Twins_, (London, 1906). Professor Harris has conclusively shown how widespread the tendency is to associate two divine or semi-divine beings in myths and legends as inseparable companions [125] or twins, like Castor and Pollux, Romulus and Remus, [126] the Acvins in the Rig-Veda, [127] Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau in the Old Testament, the Kabiri of the Phoenicians, [128] Herakles and Iphikles in Greek mythology, Ambrica and Fidelio in Teutonic mythology, Patollo and Potrimpo in old Prussian mythology, Cautes and Cautopates in Mithraism, Jesus and Thomas (according to the Syriac Acts of Thomas), and the various illustrations of "Dioscuri in Christian Legends," set forth by Dr. Harris in his work under this title, which carries the _motif_ far down into the period of legends about Christian Saints who appear in pairs, including the reference to such a pair in Shakespeare's Henry V:
        "And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by        From that day to the ending of the world."--(_Act, IV,        3, 57-58._)
There are indeed certain parallels which suggest that Enkidu-Gilgamesh may represent a Babylonian counterpart to the "Heavenly Twins." In the Indo-Iranian, Greek and Roman mythology, the twins almost invariably act together. In unison they proceed on expeditions to punish enemies. [129] But after all, the parallels are of too general a character to be of much moment; and moreover the parallels stop short at the critical point, for Gilgamesh though worsted is _not_ killed by Enkidu, whereas one of the "Heavenly Twins" is always killed by the brother, as Abel is by Cain, and Iphikles by his twin brother Herakles. Even the trait which is frequent in the earliest forms of the "Heavenly Twins," according to which one is immortal and the other is mortal, though applying in a measure to Enkidu who is killed by Ishtar, while Gilgamesh the offspring of a divine pair is only smitten with disease,
is too unsubstantial to warrant more than a general comparison between the Enkidu-Gilgamesh pair and the various forms of the "twin" _motif_ found throughout the ancient world. For all that, the point is of some interest that in the Gilgamesh Epic we should encounter two figures who are portrayed as possessing the same traits and accomplishing feats in common, which suggest a partial parallel to the various forms in which the twin-_motif_ appears in the mythologies, folk-lore and legends of many nations; and it may be that in some of these instances the duplication is due, as in the case of Enkidu and Gilgamesh, to an actual transfer of the traits of one figure to another who usurped his place.
X.
In concluding this study of the two recently discovered tablets of the old Babylonian version of the Gilgamesh Epic which has brought us several steps further in the interpretation and in our understanding of the method of composition of the most notable literary production of ancient Babylonia, it will be proper to consider the _literary_ relationship of the old Babylonian to the Assyrian version. We have already referred to the different form in which the names of the chief figures appear in the old Babylonian version, dGish as against dGish-g(n)-mash, dEn-ki-du as against dEn-ki-d, Hu-wa-wa as against Hu(m)-ba-ba. Erech appears as _Uruk ribtim_, "Erech of the Plazas," as against _Uruk supri_, "walled Erech" (or "Erech within the walls"), in the Assyrian version. [130] These variations point to an _independent_ recension for the Assyrian revision; and this conclusion is confirmed by a comparison of parallel passages in our two tablets with the Assyrian version, for such parallels rarely extend to verbal agreements in details, and, moreover, show that the Assyrian version has been elaborated. Beginning with the Pennsylvania tablet, column I is covered in the Assyrian version by tablet I, 5, 25, to 6, 33, though, as pointed out above, in the Assyrian version we have the anticipation of the dreams of Gilgamesh and their interpretation through their recital to Enkidu by his female companion, whereas in the old Babylonian version we have the dreams _directly_ given in a conversation between Gilgamesh and his mother. In the anticipation, there would naturally be some omissions. So lines 4-5 and 12-13 of the Pennsylvania tablet do not appear in the Assyrian version, but in their place is a line (I, 5, 35), to be restored to
        "[I saw him and like] a woman I fell in love with him."
which occurs in the old Babylonian version only in connection with the second dream. The point is of importance as showing that in the Babylonian version the first dream lays stress upon the omen of the falling meteor, as symbolizing the coming of Enkidu, whereas the second dream more specifically reveals Enkidu as a man, [131] of whom Gilgamesh is instantly enamored. Strikingly variant lines, though conveying the same idea, are frequent. Thus line 14 of the Babylonian version reads
        "I bore it and carried it to thee"
and appears in the Assyrian version (I, 5, 35_b_ supplied from 6, 26)
        "I threw it (or him) at thy feet" [132]
with an additional line in elaboration
        "Thou didst bring him into contact with me" [133]
which anticipates the speech of the mother
        (Line 41 = Assyrian version I, 6, 33).
Line 10 of the Pennsylvania tablet has _pa-hi-ir_ as against _iz-za-az_ I, 5, 31. Line 8 has _ik-ta-bi-it_ as against _da-an_ in the Assyrian version I, 5, 29. More significant is the variant to line 9
        "I became weak and its weight I could not bear"
as against I, 5, 30.
        "Its strength was overpowering, [134] and I could not endure        its weight."
The important lines 31-36 are not found in the Assyrian version, with the exception of I, 6, 27, which corresponds to lines 33-34, but this lack of correspondence is probably due to the fact that the Assyrian version represents the anticipation of the dreams which, as already suggested, might well omit some details. As against this we have in the Assyrian version I, 6, 23-25, an elaboration of line 30 in the Pennsylvania tablet and taken over from the recital of the first dream. Through the Assyrian version I, 6, 31-32, we can restore the closing lines of column I of the Pennsylvania tablet, while with line 33 = line 45 of the Pennsylvania tablet, the parallel between the two versions comes to an end. Lines 34-43 of the Assyrian version (bringing tablet I to a close) [135] represent an elaboration of the speech of Ninsun, followed by a further address of Gilgamesh to his mother, and by the determination of Gilgamesh to seek out Enkidu. [136] Nothing of this sort appears to have been included in the old Babylonian version.Our text proceeds with the scene between Enkidu and the woman, in which the latter by her charms and her appeal
endeavors to lead Enkidu away from his life with the animals. From the abrupt manner in which the scene is introduced in line 43 of the Pennsylvania tablet, it is evident that this cannot be the _first_ mention of the woman. The meeting must have been recounted in the first tablet, as is the case in the Assyrian version. [137] The second tablet takes up the direct recital of the dreams of Gilgamesh and then continues the narrative. Whether in the old Babylonian version the scene between Enkidu and the woman was described with the same nave details, as in the Assyrian version, of the sexual intercourse between the two for six days and seven nights cannot of course be determined, though presumably the Assyrian version, with the tendency of epics to become more elaborate as they pass from age to age, added some realistic touches. Assuming that lines 44-63 of the Pennsylvania tablet--the cohabitation of Enkidu and the address of the woman--is a repetition of what was already described in the first tablet, the comparison with the Assyrian version I, 4, 16-41, not only points to the elaboration of the later version, but likewise to an independent recension, even where parallel lines can be picked out. Only lines 46-48 of the Pennsylvania tablet form a complete parallel to line 21 of column 4 of the Assyrian version. The description in lines 22-32 of column 4 is missing, though it may, of course, have been included in part in the recital in the first tablet of the old Babylonian version. Lines 49-59 of the Pennsylvania tablet are covered by 33-39, the only slight difference being the specific mention in line 58 of the Pennsylvania tablet of Eanna, the temple in Erech, described as "the dwelling of Anu," whereas in the Assyrian version Eanna is merely referred to as the "holy house" and described as "the dwelling of Anu and Ishtar," where Ishtar is clearly a later addition. Leaving aside lines 60-61, which may be merely a variant (though independent) of line 39 of column 4 of the Assyrian version, we now have in the Pennsylvania tablet a second speech of the woman to Enkidu (not represented in the Assyrian version) beginning like the first one with _alka_, "Come" (lines 62-63), in which she asks Enkidu to leave the "accursed ground" in which he dwells. This speech, as the description which follows, extending into columns 3-4, and telling how the woman clothed Enkidu, how she brought him to the sheep folds, how she taught him to eat bread and to drink wine, and how she instructed him in the ways of civilization, must have been included in the second tablet of the Assyrian version which has come down to us in a very imperfect form. Nor is the scene in which Enkidu and Gilgamesh have their encounter found in the preserved portions of the second (or possibly the third) tablet of the Assyrian version, but only a brief reference to it in the fourth tablet, [138] in which in Epic style the story is repeated, leading up to the second exploit--the joint campaign of Enkidu and Gilgamesh against Huwawa. This reference, covering only seven lines, corresponds to lines 192-231 of the Pennsylvania tablet; but the former being the repetition and the latter the original recital, the comparison to be instituted merely reveals again the independence of the Assyrian version, as shown in the use of _kibsu_, "tread" (IV, 2, 46), for _spu_, "foot" (l. 216), _i-na-us_, "quake" (line 5C), as against _ir-tu-tu_ (ll. 221 and 226). Such variants as
        _d_Gish ribam l iddin (l. 217)
against
        _d_Gilgamesh ana surbi l namdin, (IV, 2, 47).
and again
        _issabtma kima lm_ "they grappled at the gate of the family        house" (IV, 2, 48),
against
        _issabtma ina bb bt emuti_, "they grappled at the gate of        the family house" (IV, 2, 48),
all point once more to the literary independence of the Assyrian version. The end of the conflict and the reconciliation of the two heroes is likewise missing in the Assyrian version. It may have been referred to at the beginning of column 3 [139] of Tablet IV. Coming to the Yale tablet, the few passages in which a comparison may be instituted with the fourth tablet of the Assyrian version, to which in a general way it must correspond, are not sufficient to warrant any conclusions, beyond the confirmation of the literary independence of the Assyrian version. The section comprised within lines 72-89, where Enkidu's grief at his friend's decision to fight Huwawa is described [140], and he makes confession of his own physical exhaustion, _may_ correspond to Tablet IV, column 4, of the Assyrian version. This would fit in with the beginning of the reverse, the first two lines of which (136-137) correspond to column 5 of the fourth tablet of the Assyrian version, with a variation "seven-fold fear" [141] as against "fear of men" in the Assyrian version. If lines 138-139 (in column 4) of the Yale tablet correspond to line 7 of column 5 of Tablet IV of the Assyrian version, we would again have an illustration of the elaboration of the later version by the addition of lines 3-6. But beyond this we have merely the comparison of the description of Huwawa
        "Whose roar is a flood, whose mouth is fire, and whose breath        is death"
which occurs twice in the Yale tablet (lines 110-111 and 196-197), with the same phrase in the Assyrian version Tablet IV, 5, 3--but here, as just pointed out, with an elaboration. Practically, therefore, the entire Yale tablet represents an addition to our knowledge of the Huwawa episode, and until we are fortunate enough to discover more fragments of the fourth tablet of the Assyrian version, we must content ourselves with the conclusions reached from a comparison of the Pennsylvania tablet with the parallels in the Assyrian version. It may be noted as a general point of resemblance in the exterior form
of the old Babylonian and Assyrian versions that both were inscribed on tablets containing six columns, three on the obverse and three on the reverse; and that the length of the tablets--an average of 40 to 50 lines--was about the same, thus revealing in the external form a conventiona1 size for the tablets in the older period, which was carried over into later times.
PENNSYLVANIA TABLET
The 240 lines of the six columns of the text are enumerated in succession, with an indication on the margin where a new column begins. This method, followed also in the case of the Yale tablet, seems preferable to Langdon's breaking up of the text into Obverse and Reverse, with a separate enumeration for each of the six columns. In order, however, to facilitate a comparison with Langdon's edition, a table is added:

TRANSLATION.
Col. I.        Gish sought to interpret the dream;        Spoke to his mother:        "My mother, during my night        I became strong and moved about
        among the heroes;        And from the starry heaven        A meteor(?) of Anu fell upon me:        I bore it and it grew heavy upon me,        I became weak and its weight I could not endure.        The land of Erech gathered about it.        The heroes kissed its feet. [142]        It was raised up before me.        They stood me up. [143]        I bore it and carried it to thee."        The mother of Gish, who knows all things,        Spoke to Gish:        "Some one, O Gish, who like thee        In the field was born and        Whom the mountain has reared,        Thou wilt see (him) and [like a woman(?)] thou wilt rejoice.        Heroes will kiss his feet.        Thou wilt spare [him and wilt endeavor]        To lead him to me."        He slept and saw another        Dream, which he reported to his mother:        ["My mother,] I have seen another        [Dream.] My likeness I have seen in the streets        [Of Erech] of the plazas.        An axe was brandished, and        They gathered about him;        And the axe made him angry.        I saw him and I rejoiced,        I loved him as a woman,        I embraced him.        I took him and regarded him        As my brother."        The mother of Gish, who knows all things,        [Spoke to Gish]:        ["O Gish, the man whom thou sawest,]        [Whom thou didst embrace like a woman].
Col II.        (means) that he is to be associated with thee."        Gish understood the dream.        [As] Enki[du] was sitting before the woman,        [Her] loins(?) he embraced, her vagina(?) he opened.        [Enkidu] forgot the place where he was born.        Six days and seven nights        Enkidu continued        To cohabit with [the courtesan].        [The woman] opened her [mouth] and        Spoke to Enkidu:        "I gaze upon thee, O Enkidu, like a god art thou!        Why with the cattle        Dost thou [roam] across the field?        Come, let me lead thee        into [Erech] of the plazas,        to the holy house, the dwelling of Anu,        O, Enkidu arise, let me conduct thee        To Eanna, the dwelling of Anu,        The place [where Gish is, perfect] in vitality.
        And thou [like a wife wilt embrace] him.        Thou [wilt love him like] thyself.        Come, arise from the ground        (that is) cursed."        He heard her word and accepted her speech.        The counsel of the woman        Entered his heart.        She stripped off a garment,        Clothed him with one.        Another garment        She kept on herself.        She took hold of his hand.        Like [a god(?)] she brought him        To the fertile meadow,        The place of the sheepfolds.        In that place they received food;        [For he, Enkidu, whose birthplace was the mountain,]        [With the gazelles he was accustomed to eat herbs,]        [With the cattle to drink water,]        [With the water beings he was happy.]
(Perhaps one additional line missing.)
Col. III.        Milk of the cattle        He was accustomed to suck.        Food they placed before him,        He broke (it) off and looked        And gazed.        Enkidu had not known        To eat food.        To drink wine        He had not been taught.        The woman opened her mouth and        Spoke to Enkidu:        "Eat food, O Enkidu,        The provender of life!        Drink wine, the custom of the land!"        Enkidu ate food        Till he was satiated.        Wine he drank,        Seven goblets.        His spirit was loosened, he became hilarious.        His heart became glad and        His face shone.        [The barber(?)] removed        The hair on his body.        He was anointed with oil.        He became manlike.        He put on a garment,        He was like a man.        He took his weapon;        Lions he attacked,        (so that) the night shepherds could rest.        He plunged the dagger;        Lions he overcame.
        The great [shepherds] lay down;        Enkidu was their protector.        The strong man,        The unique hero,        To [the shepherds(?)] he speaks:

        Making merry.        He lifted up his eyes,        He sees the man.        He spoke to the woman:        "O, courtesan, lure on the man.        Why has he come to me?        His name I will destroy."        The woman called to the man        Who approaches to him [144] and he beholds him.        "Away! why dost thou [quake(?)]        Evil is the course of thy activity." [145]        Then he [146] opened his mouth and        Spoke to Enkidu:        "[To have (?)] a family home        Is the destiny of men, and        The prerogative(?) of the nobles.        For the city(?) load the workbaskets!        Food supply for the city lay to one side!        For the King of Erech of the plazas,        Open the hymen(?), perform the marriage act!        For Gish, the King of Erech of the plazas,        Open the hymen(?),        Perform the marriage act!        With the legitimate wife one should cohabit.        So before,        As well as in the future. [147]        By the decree pronounced by a god,        From the cutting of his umbilical cord        (Such) is his fate."        At the speech of the hero        His face grew pale.

        [Enkidu] went [in front],        And the courtesan behind him.
        He entered into Erech of the plazas.        The people gathered about him.        As he stood in the streets        Of Erech of the plazas,        The men gathered,        Saying in regard to him:        "Like the form of Gish he has suddenly become;        shorter in stature.        [In his structure high(?)], powerful,        .......... overseeing(?)        In the land strong of power has he become.        Milk of cattle        He was accustomed to suck."        Steadily(?) in Erech .....        The heroes rejoiced.        He became a leader.        To the hero of fine appearance,        To Gish, like a god,        He became a rival to him. [148]        For Ishhara a couch        Was stretched, and        Gish [lay down, and afterwards(?)]        In the night he fled.        He approaches and        [Enkidu stood] in the streets.        He blocked the path        of Gish.        At the exhibit of his power,

        Strong(?) ...        Gish        Against him [Enkidu proceeded],        [His hair] luxuriant.        He started [to go]        Towards him.        They met in the plaza of the district.        Enkidu blocked the gate        With his foot,        Not permitting Gish to enter.        They seized (each other), like oxen,        They fought.        The threshold they demolished;        The wall they impaired.        Gish and Enkidu        Seized (each other).        Like oxen they fought.        The threshold they demolished;        The wall they impaired.        Gish bent
        His foot to the ground, [149]        His wrath was appeased,        His breast was quieted.        When his breast was quieted,        Enkidu to him        Spoke, to Gish:        "As a unique one, thy mother        bore thee.        The wild cow of the stall, [150]        Ninsun,        Has exalted thy head above men.        Kingship over men        Enlil has decreed for thee.        Second tablet,        enlarged beyond [the original(?)].        240 lines.
COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.
Line 1. The verb _tib_ with _pasru_ expresses the aim of Gish to secure an interpretation for his dream. This disposes of Langdon's note 1 on page 211 of his edition, in which he also erroneously speaks of our text as "late." _Pasru_ is not a variant of _zakru_. Both verbs occur just as here in the Assyrian version I, 5, 25. Line 3. _ina st musitia_, "in this my night," i.e., in the course of this night of mine. A curious way of putting it, but the expression occurs also in the Assyrian version, e.g., I, 5, 26 (parallel passage to ours) and II, 4a, 14. In the Yale tablet we find, similarly, _mu-si-it-ka_ (l. 262), "thy night," i.e., "at night to thee." Line 5. Before Langdon put down the strange statement of Gish "wandering about in the midst of omens" (misreading _id-da-tim _ for _it-lu-tim_), he might have asked himself the question, what it could possibly mean. How can one walk among omens? Line 6. _ka-ka-bu s-ma-i_ must be taken as a compound term for "starry heaven." The parallel passage in the Assyrian version (Tablet I, 5, 27) has the ideograph for star, with the plural sign as a variant. Literally, therefore, "The starry heaven (or "the stars in heaven") was there," etc. Langdon's note 2 on page 211 rests on an erroneous reading. Line 7. _kisru s Anim_, "mass of Anu," appears to be the designation of a meteor, which might well be described as a "mass" coming from Anu, i.e., from the god of heaven who becomes the personification of the heavens in general. In the Assyrian version (I, 5, 28) we have _kima ki-is-r_, i.e., "something like a mass of heaven." Note also I, 3, 16, where in a description of Gilgamesh, his strength is said to be "strong like a mass (i.e., a meteor) of heaven." Line 9. For _nussasu l ilt_ we have a parallel in the Hebrew phrase NLE'ETIY NS' (Isaiah 1, 14).
Line 10. _Uruk mtum_, as the designation for the district of Erech, occurs in the Assyrian version, e.g., I, 5, 31, and IV, 2, 38; also to be supplied, I, 6, 23. For _pahir_ the parallel in the Assyrian version has _iz-za-az_ (I, 5, 31), but VI, 197, we find _pah-ru_ and _pah-ra_. Line 17. _mi-in-di_ does not mean "truly" as Langdon translates, but "some one." It occurs also in the Assyrian version X, 1, 13, _mi-in-di-e ma-an-nu-u_, "this is some one who," etc. Line 18. Cf. Assyrian version I, 5, 3, and IV, 4, 7, _ina siri lid_--both passages referring to Enkidu. Line 21. Cf. Assyrian version II, 3b, 38, with _malk_, "kings," as a synonym of _itlutum_. Line 23. _ta-tar-ra-as-s_ from _tarsu_,  "direct," "guide," etc. Line 24. I take _us-ti-nim-ma_ as III, 2, from _isnu_ (YOSEN), the verb underlying _sittu_, "sleep," and _suttu_, "dream." Line 26. Cf. Assyrian version I, 6, 21--a complete parallel. Line 28. _Uruk ri-bi-tim_, the standing phrase in both tablets of the old Babylonian version, for which in the Assyrian version we have _Uruk su-pu-ri_. The former term suggests the "broad space" outside of the city or the "common" in a village community, while _supri_, "enclosed," would refer to the city within the walls. Dr. W. F. Albright (in a private communication) suggests "Erech of the plazas" as a suitable translation for _Uruk ribtim_. A third term, _Uruk mtum_ (see above, note to line 10), though designating rather the district of which Erech was the capital, appears to be used as a synonym to _Uruk ribtim_, as may be concluded from the phrase _i-na ri-bi-tum ma-ti_ (l. 214 of the Pennsylvania tablet), which clearly means the "plaza" of the city. One naturally thinks of REHOBOT `IYR in Genesis 10, 11--the equivalent of Babylonian _ri-bi-tu li_--which can hardly be the name of a city. It appears to be a gloss, as is HIY' HO`IYR HAGEDOLOH at the end of v. 12. The latter gloss is misplaced, since it clearly describes "Nineveh," mentioned in v. 11. Inasmuch as REHOBOT `IYR immediately follows the mention of Nineveh, it seems simplest to take the phrase as designating the "outside" or "suburbs" of the city, a complete parallel, therefore, to _ri-bi-tu mti_ in our text. Nineveh, together with the "suburbs," forms the "great city." _Uruk ribtim_ is, therefore, a designation for "greater Erech," proper to a capital city, which by its gradual growth would take in more than its original confines. "Erech of the plazas" must have come to be used as a honorific designation of this important center as early as 2000 B. C., whereas later, perhaps because of its decline, the epithet no longer seemed appropriate and was replaced by the more modest designation of "walled Erech," with an allusion to the tradition which ascribed the building of the wall of the city to Gilgamesh. At all events, all three expressions, "Erech of the plazas," "Erech walled" and "Erech land," are to be regarded as synonymous. The position once held by Erech follows also from its ideographic designation (Brnnow No. 4796) by the sign "house" with a "gunufied" extension, which conveys the idea of Unu = _subtu_, or "dwelling" _par excellence_. The pronunciation Unug or Unuk (see the gloss _u-nu-uk_, VR 23, 8a), composed of _unu_, "dwelling," and
_ki_, "place," is hardly to be regarded as older than Uruk, which is to be resolved into _uru_, "city," and _ki_, "place," but rather as a play upon the name, both Unu + ki and Uru + ki conveying the same idea of _the_ city or _the_ dwelling place _par excellence_. As the seat of the second oldest dynasty according to Babylonian traditions (see Poebel's list in _Historical and Grammatical Texts_ No. 2), Erech no doubt was regarded as having been at one time "the city," i.e., the capital of the entire Euphrates Valley. Line 31. A difficult line for which Langdon proposes the translation: "Another axe seemed his visage"!!--which may be picturesque, but hardly a description befitting a hero. How can a man's face seem to be an axe? Langdon attaches _s-ni_ in the sense of "second" to the preceding word "axe," whereas _san bunusu_, "change of his countenance" or "his countenance being changed," is to be taken as a phrase to convey the idea of "being disturbed," "displeased" or "angry." The phrase is of the same kind as the well-known _sunnu tmu_, "changing of reason," to denote "insanity." See the passages in Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, pp. 355 and 1068. In Hebrew, too, we have the same two phrases, e.g., VAYESANOV 'ETTA`EMOV (I Sam. 21, 14 = Ps. 34, 1), "and he changed his reason," i.e., feigned insanity and MESANEH PONOYV (Job 14, 20), "changing his face," to indicate a radical alteration in the frame of mind. There is a still closer parallel in Biblical Aramaic: Dan. 3, 19, "The form of his visage was changed," meaning "he was enraged." Fortunately, the same phrase occurs also in the Yale tablet (l. 192), _s-nu- bu-nu-s_, in a connection which leaves no doubt that the aroused fury of the tyrant Huwawa is described by it:
        "Huwawa heard and his face was changed"
precisely, therefore, as we should say--following Biblical usage--"his countenance fell." Cf. also the phrase _pnusu arpu_, "his countenance was darkened" (Assyrian version I, 2, 48), to express "anger." The line, therefore, in the Pennsylvania tablet must describe Enkidu's anger. With the brandishing of the axe the hero's anger was also stirred up. The touch was added to prepare us for the continuation in which Gish describes how, despite this (or perhaps just because of it), Enkidu seemed so attractive that Gish instantly fell in love with him. May perhaps the emphatic form _hasinumma_ (line 31) against _hasinu_ (line 29) have been used to indicate "The axe it was," or "because of the axe?" It would be worth while to examine other texts of the Hammurabi period with a view of determining the scope in the use and meaning of the emphatic _ma_ when added to a substantive. Line 32. The combination _amur  ahtadu_ occurs also in the El-Amarna Letters, No. 18, 12. Line 34. In view of the common Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic Hobab "to love," it seems preferable to read here, as in the other passages in the Assyrian versions (I, 4, 15; 4, 35; 6, 27, etc.), _a-ha-ab-bu-ub_, _ah-bu-ub_, _ih-bu-bu_, etc. (instead of with _p_), and to render "embrace." Lines 38-40, completing the column, may be supplied from the Assyrian version I, 6, 30-32, in conjunction with lines 33-34 of our text. The beginning of line 32 in Jensen's version is therefore to be filled
out _[ta-ra-am-s ki]-i_. Line 43. The restoration at the beginning of this line
        _En-ki-[du wa]-si-ib ma-har ha-ri-im-tim_
enables us to restore also the beginning of the second tablet of the Assyrian version (cf. the colophon of the fragment 81, 7-27, 93, in Jeremias, _Izdubar-Nimrod_, plate IV = Jensen, p. 134),
        _[d_En-ki-du wa-si-ib] ma-har-s.
Line 44. The restoration of this line is largely conjectural, based on the supposition that its contents correspond in a general way to I, 4, 16, of the Assyrian version. The reading _di-da_ is quite certain, as is also _ip-ti-[e]_; and since both words occur in the line of the Assyrian version in question, it is tempting to supply at the beginning _ur-[s]_ = "her loins" (cf. Holma, _Namen der Krperteile_, etc., p. 101), which is likewise found in the same line of the Assyrian version. At all events the line describes the fascination exercised upon Enkidu by the woman's bodily charms, which make him forget everything else. Lines 46-47 form a parallel to I, 4, 21, of the Assyrian version. The form _samkatu_, "courtesan," is constant in the old Babylonian version (ll. 135 and 172), as against _samhatu_ in the Assyrian version (I, 3, 19, 40, 45; 4, 16), which also uses the plural _sam-ha-a-ti_ (II, 3b, 40). The interchange between _h_ and _k_ is not without precedent (cf. Meissner, _Altbabylonisches Privatrecht_, page 107, note 2, and more particularly Chiera, _List of Personal Names_, page 37). In view of the evidence, set forth in the Introduction, for the assumption that the Enkidu story has been combined with a tale of the evolution of primitive man to civilized life, it is reasonable to suggest that in the original Enkidu story the female companion was called _samkatu_, "courtesan," whereas in the tale of the primitive man, which was transferred to Enkidu, the associate was _harimtu_, a "woman," just as in the Genesis tale, the companion of Adam is simply called _ishsh_, "woman." Note that in the Assyrian parallel (Tablet I, 4, 26) we have two readings, _ir-hi_ (imperf.) and a variant _i-ri-hi_ (present). The former is the better reading, as our tablet shows. Lines 49-59 run parallel to the Assyrian version I, 4, 33-38, with slight variations which have been discussed above, p. 58, and from which we may conclude that the Assyrian version represents an independent redaction. Since in our tablet we have presumably the repetition of what may have been in part at least set forth in the first tablet of the old Babylonian version, we must not press the parallelism with the first tablet of the Assyrian version too far; but it is noticeable nevertheless (1) that our tablet contains lines 57-58 which are not represented in the Assyrian version, and (2) that the second speech of the "woman" beginning, line 62, with _al-ka_, "come" (just as the first speech, line 54), is likewise not found in the first tablet of the Assyrian version; which on the other hand contains a line (39) not in the Babylonian version, besides
the detailed answer of Enkidu (I 4, 42-5, 5). Line 6, which reads "Enkidu and the woman went (_il-li-ku_) to walled Erech," is also not found in the second tablet of the old Babylonian version. Line 63. For _magr_, "accursed," see the frequent use in Astrological texts (Jastrow, _Religion Babyloniens und Assyriens_ II, page 450, note 2). Langdon, by his strange error in separating _ma-a-ag-ri-im_ into two words _ma-a-ak_ and _ri-i-im_, with a still stranger rendering: "unto the place yonder of the shepherds!!", naturally misses the point of this important speech. Line 64 corresponds to I, 4, 40, of the Assyrian version, which has an additional line, leading to the answer of Enkidu. From here on, our tablet furnishes material not represented in the Assyrian version, but which was no doubt included in the second tablet of that version of which we have only a few fragments. Line 70 must be interpreted as indicating that the woman kept one garment for herself. _Ittalbas_ would accordingly mean, "she kept on." The female dress appears to have consisted of an upper and a lower garment. Line 72. The restoration "like a god" is favored by line 51, where Enkidu is likened to a god, and is further confirmed by l. 190. Line 73. _gupru_ is identical with _gu-up-ri_ (Thompson, _Reports of the Magicians and Astrologers_, etc., 223 rev. 2 and 223a rev. 8), and must be correlated to _gipru_ (Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 229a), "planted field," "meadow," and the like. Thompson's translation "men" (as though a synonym of _gabru_) is to be corrected accordingly. Line 74. There is nothing missing between _a-sar_ and _tar-ba-si-im_. Line 75. _ri-ia-_, which Langdon renders "shepherd," is the equivalent of the Arabic _ri'y_ and Hebrew RE`IY "pasturage," "fodder." We have usually the feminine form _ri-i-tu_ (Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 990b). The break at the end of the second column is not serious. Evidently Enkidu, still accustomed to live like an animal, is first led to the sheepfolds, and this suggests a repetition of the description of his former life. Of the four or five lines missing, we may conjecturally restore four, on the basis of the Assyrian version, Tablet I, 4, 2-5, or I, 2, 39-41. This would then join on well to the beginning of column 3. Line 81. Both here and in l. 52 our text has _na-ma-s-te-e_, as against _nam-mas-si-i_ in the Assyrian version, e.g., Tablet I, 2, 41; 4, 5, etc.,--the feminine form, therefore, as against the masculine. Langdon's note 3 on page 213 is misleading. In astrological texts we also find _nam-mas-te_; e.g., Thompson, _Reports of the Magicians and Astrologers_, etc., No. 200, Obv. 2. Line 93. _zi-ma-at_ (for _simat_) _ba-la-ti-im_ is not "conformity of life" as Langdon renders, but that which "belongs to life" like _si-mat pag-ri-s_, "belonging to her body," in the Assyrian version III, 2a, 3 (Jensen, page 146). "Food," says the woman, "is the staff of life." Line 94. Langdon's strange rendering "of the conditions and fate
of the land" rests upon an erroneous reading (see the corrections, Appendix I), which is the more inexcusable because in line 97 the same ideogram, Ks = _sikaru_, "wine," occurs, and is correctly rendered by him. _Simti mti_ is not the "fate of the land," but the "fixed custom of the land." Line 98. _as-sa-mi-im_ (plural of _assamu_), which Langdon takes as an adverb in the sense of "times," is a well-known word for a large "goblet," which occurs in Incantation texts, e.g., _CT_ XVI, 24, obv. 1, 19, _m a-sa-am-mi-e s-puk_, "pour out goblets of water." Line 18 of the passage shoves that _asammu_ is a Sumerian loan word. Line 99. _it-tap-sar_, I, 2, from _pasru_, "loosen." In combination with _kabtatum_ (from _kabitatum_, yielding two forms: _kabtatum_, by elision of _i_, and _kabittu_, by elision of _a_), "liver," _pasru_ has the force of becoming cheerful. Cf. _ka-bit-ta-ki lip-pa-sir_ (_ZA_ V., p. 67, line 14). Line 100, note the customary combination of "liver" (_kabtatum_) and "heart" (_libbu_) for "disposition" and "mind," just as in the standing phrase in penitential prayers: "May thy liver be appeased, thy heart be quieted." Line 102. The restoration [lS]-I = _gallabu_ "barber" (Delitzsch, _Sumer. Glossar_, p. 267) was suggested to me by Dr. H. F. Lutz. The ideographic writing "raising the hand" is interesting as recalling the gesture of shaving or cutting. Cf. a reference to a barber in Lutz, _Early Babylonian Letters from Larsa_, No. 109, 6. Line 103. Langdon has correctly rendered _suhuru_ as "hair," and has seen that we have here a loan-word from the Sumerian Suhur = _kimmatu_, "hair," according to the Syllabary Sb 357 (cf. Delitzsch, _Sumer. Glossar._, p. 253). For _kimmatu_, "hair," more specifically hair of the head and face, see Holma, _Namen der Krperteile_, page 3. The same sign Suhur or Suh (Brnnow No. 8615), with Lal, i.e., "hanging hair," designates the "beard" (_ziknu_, cf. Brnnow, No. 8620, and Holma, l. c., p. 36), and it is interesting to note that we have _suhuru_ (introduced as a loan-word) for the barbershop, according to II R, 21, 27c (= _CT_ XII, 41).
         suhur(ra) (i.e., house of the hair) = _s-hu-ru_.
In view of all this, we may regard as assured Holma's conjecture to read _s-[hur-ma-s]_ in the list 93074 obv. (_MVAG_ 1904, p. 203; and Holma, _Beitrge z. Assyr. Lexikon_, p. 36), as the Akkadian equivalent to Suhur-Mas-Ha and the name of a fish, so called because it appeared to have a double "beard" (cf. Holma, _Namen der Krperteile_). One is tempted, furthermore, to see in the difficult word SKYRH (Isaiah 7, 20) a loan-word from our _suhuru_, and to take the words 'ETHORO'S VESA`AR HORAGELAYIM "the head and hair of the feet" (euphemistic for the hair around the privates), as an explanatory gloss to the rare word Skyrh for "hair" of the body in general--just as in the passage in the Pennsylvania tablet. The verse in Isaiah would then read, "The Lord on that day will shave with the razor the hair (HSKYRH), and even the beard will be removed." The rest of the verse would represent a series of explanatory glosses: (a) "Beyond the river" (i.e., Assyria), a gloss to YEGALAH (b) "with the king of Assyria,"
a gloss to BETA`AR "with a razor;" and (c) "the hair of the head and hair of the feet," a gloss to HSKYRH. For "hair of the feet" we have an interesting equivalent in Babylonian _su-hur_ (and _s-hu-ur_) _spi_ (_CT_ XII, 41, 23-24 c-d). Cf. also Boissier, _Documents Assyriens relatifs aux Prsages_, p. 258, 4-5. The Babylonian phrase is like the Hebrew one to be interpreted as a euphemism for the hair around the male or female organ. To be sure, the change from H to K in HSKYRH constitutes an objection, but not a serious one in the case of a loan-word, which would aim to give the _pronunciation_ of the original word, rather than the correct etymological equivalent. The writing with aspirated K fulfills this condition. (Cf. _samkatum_ and _samhatum_, above p. 73). The passage in Isaiah being a reference to Assyria, the prophet might be tempted to use a foreign word to make his point more emphatic. To take HSKYRH as "hired," as has hitherto been done, and to translate "with a hired razor," is not only to suppose a very wooden metaphor, but is grammatically difficult, since HSKYRH would be a feminine adjective attached to a masculine substantive. Coming back to our passage in the Pennsylvania tablet, it is to be noted that Enkidu is described as covered "all over his body with hair" (Assyrian version, Tablet I, 2, 36) like an animal. To convert him into a civilized man, the hair is removed. Line 107. _mutu_ does not mean "husband" here, as Langdon supposes, but must be taken as in l. 238 in the more general sense of "man," for which there is good evidence. Line 109. _la-bi_ (plural form) are "lions"--not "panthers" as Langdon has it. The verb _-gi-ir-ri_ is from _gru_, "to attack." Langdon by separating __ from _gi-ir-ri_ gets a totally wrong and indeed absurd meaning. See the corrections in the Appendix. He takes the sign __ for the copula (!!) which of course is impossible. Line 110. Read _us-sa-ak-pu_, III, 1, of _sakpu_, which is frequently used for "lying down" and is in fact a synonym of _sallu_. See Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, page 758a. The original has very clearly Sb (= _r'u_, "shepherd") with the plural sign. The "shepherds of the night," who could now rest since Enkidu had killed the lions, are of course the shepherds who were accustomed to watch the flocks during the night. Line 111. _ut-tap-pi-is_ is II, 2, _napsu_, "to make a hole," hence "to plunge" in connection with a weapon. _Sib-ba-ri_ is, of course, not "mountain goats," as Langdon renders, but a by-form to _sibbiru_, "stick," and designates some special weapon. Since on seal cylinders depicting Enkidu killing lions and other animals the hero is armed with a dagger, this is presumably the weapon _sibbaru_. Line 113. Langdon's translation is again out of the question and purely fanciful. The traces favor the restoration _na-ki-[di-e]_, "shepherds," and since the line appears to be a parallel to line 110, I venture to suggest at the beginning _[it-ti]-lu_ from _na'lu_, "lie down"--a synonym, therefore, to _sakpu_ in line 110. The shepherds can sleep quietly after Enkidu has become the "guardian" of the flocks. In the Assyrian version (tablet II, 3a, 4) Enkidu is called a _na-kid_, "shepherd," and in the preceding line we likewise have lNa-Kid with the plural sign, i.e., "shepherds." This would point to _nakidu_ being a Sumerian loan-word, unless it is _vice versa_, a word that has gone over into the Sumerian from Akkadian. Is perhaps the fragment
in question (K 8574) in the Assyrian version (Haupt's ed. No. 25) the _parallel_ to our passage? If in line 4 of this fragment we could read _s_ for _sa_, i.e., _na-kid-s-nu_, "their shepherd, we would have a parallel to line 114 of the Pennsylvania tablet, with _na-kid_ as a synonym to _massaru_, "protector." The preceding line would then be completed as follows:
        _[it-ti-lu]-nim-ma na-kidmes_ [ra-bu-tum]
(or perhaps only _it-ti-lu-ma_, since the _nim_ is not certain) and would correspond to line 113 of the Pennsylvania tablet. Inasmuch as the writing on the tiny fragment is very much blurred, it is quite possible that in line 2 we must read _sib-ba-ri_ (instead of _bar-ba-ri_), which would furnish a parallel to line 111 of the Pennsylvania tablet. The difference between Bar and Sib is slight, and the one sign might easily be mistaken for the other in the case of close writing. The continuation of line 2 of the fragment would then correspond to line 112 of the Pennsylvania tablet, while line 1 of the fragment might be completed _[re-e]-u-ti(?) s [mu-si-a-tim]_, though this is by no means certain. The break at the close of column 3 (about 5 lines) and the top of column 4 (about 8 lines) is a most serious interruption in the narrative, and makes it difficult to pick up the thread where the tablet again becomes readable. We cannot be certain whether the "strong man, the unique hero" who addresses some one (lines 115-117) is Enkidu or Gish or some other personage, but presumably Gish is meant. In the Assyrian version, Tablet I, 3, 2 and 29, we find Gilgamesh described as the "unique hero" and in l. 234 of the Pennsylvania tablet Gish is called "unique," while again, in the Assyrian version, Tablet I, 2, 15 and 26, he is designated as _gasru_ as in our text. Assuming this, whom does he address? Perhaps the shepherds? In either case he receives an answer that rejoices him. If the fragment of the Assyrian version (K 8574) above discussed is the equivalent to the close of column 3 of the Pennsylvania tablet, we may go one step further, and with some measure of assurance assume that Gish is told of Enkidu's exploits and that the latter is approaching Erech. This pleases Gish, but Enkidu when he sees Gish(?) is stirred to anger and wants to annihilate him. At this point, the "man" (who is probably Gish, though the possibility of a third personage must be admitted) intervenes and in a long speech sets forth the destiny and higher aims of mankind. The contrast between Enkidu and Gish (or the third party) is that between the primitive savage and the civilized being. The contrast is put in the form of an opposition between the two. The primitive man is the stronger and wishes to destroy the one whom he regards as a natural foe and rival. On the other hand, the one who stands on a higher plane wants to lift his fellow up. The whole of column 4, therefore, forms part of the lesson attached to the story of Enkidu, who, identified with man in a primitive stage, is made the medium of illustrating how the higher plane is reached through the guiding influences of the woman's hold on man, an influence exercised, to be sure, with the help of her bodily charms. Line 135. _uk-ki-si_ (imperative form) does not mean "take away," as Langdon (who entirely misses the point of the whole passage) renders, but on the contrary, "lure him on," "entrap him," and the like. The verb occurs also in the Yale tablet, ll. 183 and 186.
Line 137. Langdon's note to _lu-us-s_ had better be passed over in silence. The form is II. 1, from _es_, "destroy." Line 139. Since the man whom the woman calls approaches Enkidu, the subject of both verbs is the man, and the object is Enkidu; i.e., therefore, "The man approaches Enkidu and beholds him." Line 140. Langdon's interpretation of this line again is purely fanciful. _E-di-il_ cannot, of course, be a "phonetic variant" of _edir_; and certainly the line does not describe the state of mind of the woman. Lines 140-141 are to be taken as an expression of amazement at Enkidu's appearance. The first word appears to be an imperative in the sense of "Be off," "Away," from _dlu_, "move, roam." The second word _e-es_, "why," occurs with the same verb _dlu_ in the Meissner fragment: _e-es ta-da-al_ (column 3, 1), "why dost thou roam about?" The verb at the end of the line may perhaps be completed to _ta-hi-il-la-am_. The last sign appears to be _am_, but may be _ma_, in which case we should have to complete simply _ta-hi-il-ma_. _Tahl_ would be the second person present of _hlu_. Cf. _i-hi-il_, frequently in astrological texts, e.g., Virolleaud, _Adad_ No. 3, lines 21 and 33. Line 141. The reading _lim-nu_ at the beginning, instead of Langdon's _mi-nu_, is quite certain, as is also _ma-na-ah-ti-ka_ instead of what Langdon proposes, which gives no sense whatever. _Manahtu_ in the sense of the "toil" and "activity of life" (like `OMOL throughout the Book of Ecclesiastes) occurs in the introductory lines to the Assyrian version of the Epic I, 1, 8, _ka-lu ma-na-ah-ti-[su]_, "all of his toil," i.e., all of his career. Line 142. The subject of the verb cannot be the woman, as Langdon supposes, for the text in that case, e.g., line 49, would have said _pi-s_ ("her mouth") not _pi-s_ ("his mouth"). The long speech, detailing the function and destiny of civilized man, is placed in the mouth of the man who meets Enkidu. In the Introduction it has been pointed out that lines 149 and 151 of the speech appear to be due to later modifications of the speech designed to connect the episode with Gish. Assuming this to be the case, the speech sets forth the following five distinct aims of human life: (1) establishing a home (line 144), (2) work (line 147), (3) storing up resources (line 148), (4) marriage (line 150), (5) monogamy (line 154); all of which is put down as established for all time by divine decree (lines 155-157), and as man's fate from his birth (lines 158-159). Line 144. _bi-ti-is e-mu-ti_ is for _bti s e-mu-ti_, just as _kab-lu-us Ti-a-ma-ti_ (Assyrian Creation Myth, IV, 65) stands for _kablu s Tiamti_. Cf. _bt e-mu-ti_ (Assyrian version, IV, 2, 46 and 48). The end of the line is lost beyond recovery, but the general sense is clear. Line 146. _tu-a-ar_ is a possible reading. It may be the construct of _tu-a-ru_, of frequent occurrence in legal texts and having some such meaning as "right," "claim" or "prerogative." See the passages given by Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 1139b. Line 148. The reading _uk-la-at_, "food," and then in the wider sense "food supply," "provisions," is quite certain. The fourth sign
looks like the one for "city." _E-mi-sa_ may stand for _e-mid-sa_, "place it." The general sense of the line, at all events, is clear, as giving the advice to gather resources. It fits in with the Babylonian outlook on life to regard work and wealth as the fruits of work and as a proper purpose in life. Line 150 (repeated lines 152-153) is a puzzling line. To render _piti pk epsi_ (or _episi_), as Langdon proposes, "open, addressing thy speech," is philologically and in every other respect inadmissible. The word _pu-uk_ (which Langdon takes for "thy mouth"!!) can, of course, be nothing but the construct form of _pukku_, which occurs in the Assyrian version in the sense of "net" (_pu-uk-ku_ I, 2, 9 and 21, and also in the colophon to the eleventh tablet furnishing the beginning of the twelfth tablet (Haupt's edition No. 56), as well as in column 2, 29, and column 3, 6, of this twelfth tablet). In the two last named passages _pukku_ is a synonym of _mek_, which from the general meaning of "enclosure" comes to be a euphemistic expression for the female organ. So, for example, in the Assyrian Creation Myth, Tablet IV, 66 (synonym of _kablu_, "waist," etc.). See Holma, _Namen der Krperteile_, page 158. Our word _pukku_ must be taken in this same sense as a designation of the female organ--perhaps more specifically the "hymen" as the "net," though the womb in general might also be designated as a "net" or "enclosure." _Kak-(si)_ is no doubt to be read _epsi_, as Langdon correctly saw; or perhaps better, _episi_. An expression like _ip-si-s lul-la-a_ (Assyrian version, I, 4, 13; also line 19, _i-pu-us-su-ma lul-la-a_), with the explanation _sipir zinnisti_, "the work of woman" (i.e., after the fashion of woman), shows that _epsu_ is used in connection with the sexual act. The phrase _pit pk episi a-na ha-a-a-ri_, literally "open the net, perform the act for marriage," therefore designates the fulfillment of the marriage act, and the line is intended to point to marriage with the accompanying sexual intercourse as one of the duties of man. While the general meaning is thus clear, the introduction of Gish is puzzling, except on the supposition that lines 149 and 151 represent later additions to connect the speech, detailing the advance to civilized life, with the hero. See above, p. 45 _seq._ Line 154. _assat simtim_ is the "legitimate wife," and the line inculcates monogamy as against promiscuous sexual intercourse. We know that monogamy was the rule in Babylonia, though a man could in addition to the wife recognized as the legalized spouse take a concubine, or his wife could give her husband a slave as a concubine. Even in that case, according to the Hammurabi Code, 145-146, the wife retained her status. The Code throughout assumes that a man has only _one_ wife--the _assat simtim_ of our text. The phrase "so" (or "that") before "as afterwards" is to be taken as an idiomatic expression--"so it was and so it should be for all times"--somewhat like the phrase _mahriam  arkiam_, "for all times," in legal documents (_CT_ VIII, 38c, 22-23). For the use of _mk_ see Behrens, _Assyrisch-Babylonische Briefe_, p. 3. Line 158. _i-na bi-ti-ik a-bu-un-na-ti-s_. Another puzzling line, for which Langdon proposes "in the work of his presence," which is as obscure as the original. In a note he says that _apunnti_ means "nostrils," which is certainly wrong. There has been considerable discussion about this term (see Holma, _Namen der Krperteile_, pages 150 and 157), the meaning of which has been advanced by Christian's discussion in _OLZ_ 1914, p. 397. From this it appears that it must designate a part of the body which could acquire a wider
significance so as to be used as a synonym for "totality," since it appears in a list of equivalent for Dur = _nap-ha-ru_, "totality," _ka-lu-ma_, "all," _a-bu-un-na-tum e-si-im-tum_, "bony structure," and _kul-la-tum_, "totality" (_CT_ XII, 10, 7-10). Christian shows that it may be the "navel," which could well acquire a wider significance for the body in general; but we may go a step further and specify the "umbilical cord" (tentatively suggested also by Christian) as the primary meaning, then the "navel," and from this the "body" in general. The structure of the umbilical cord as a series of strands would account for designating it by a plural form _abunnti_, as also for the fact that one could speak of a right and left side of the _appunnti_. To distinguish between the "umbilical cord" and the "navel," the ideograph Dur (the common meaning of which is _riksu_, "bond" [Delitzsch, _Sumer. Glossar._, p. 150]), was used for the former, while for the latter Li Dur was employed, though the reading in Akkadian in both cases was the same. The expression "with (or at) the cutting of his umbilical cord" would mean, therefore, "from his birth"--since the cutting of the cord which united the child with the mother marks the beginning of the separate life. Lines 158-159, therefore, in concluding the address to Enkidu, emphasize in a picturesque way that what has been set forth is man's fate for which he has been destined from birth. [See now Albright's remarks on _abunnatu_ in the Revue d'Assyriologie 16, pp. 173-175, with whose conclusion, however, that it means primarily "backbone" and then "stature," I cannot agree.] In the break of about three lines at the bottom of column 4, and of about six at the beginning of column 5, there must have been set forth the effect of the address on Enkidu and the indication of his readiness to accept the advice; as in a former passage (line 64), Enkidu showed himself willing to follow the woman. At all events the two now proceed to the heart of the city. Enkidu is in front and the woman behind him. The scene up to this point must have taken place outside of Erech--in the suburbs or approaches to the city, where the meadows and the sheepfolds were situated. Line 174. _um-ma-nu-um_ are not the "artisans," as Langdon supposes, but the "people" of Erech, just as in the Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 1, 40, where the word occurs in connection with _i-dip-pi-ir_, which is perhaps to be taken as a synonym of _pahru_, "gather;" so also _i-dip-pir_ (Tablet I, 2, 40) "gathers with the flock." Lines 180-182 must have contained the description of Enkidu's resemblance to Gish, but the lines are too mutilated to permit of any certain restoration. See the corrections (Appendix) for a suggested reading for the end of line 181. Line 183 can be restored with considerable probability on the basis of the Assyrian version, Tablet I, 3, 3 and 30, where Enkidu is described as one "whose power is strong in the land." Lines 186-187. The puzzling word, to be read apparently _kak-ki-a-tum_, can hardly mean "weapons," as Langdon proposes. In that case we should expect _kakk_; and, moreover, to so render gives no sense, especially since the verb _-te-el-li-lu_ is without much question to be rendered "rejoiced," and not "purified." _Kakkiatum_--if this be the correct reading--may be a designation of Erech like _ribtim_. Lines 188-189 are again entirely misunderstood by Langdon, owing to
erroneous readings. See the corrections in the Appendix. Line 190. _i-li-im_ in this line is used like Hebrew Elohm, "God." Line 191. _sakissum_ = _sakin-sum_, as correctly explained by Langdon. Line 192. With this line a new episode begins which, owing to the gap at the beginning of column 6, is somewhat obscure. The episode leads to the hostile encounter between Gish and Enkidu. It is referred to in column 2 of the fourth tablet of the Assyrian version. Lines 35-50--all that is preserved of this column--form in part a parallel to columns 5-6 of the Pennsylvania tablet, but in much briefer form, since what on the Pennsylvania tablet is the incident itself is on the fourth tablet of the Assyrian version merely a repeated summary of the relationship between the two heroes, leading up to the expedition against Hu(m)baba. Lines 38-40 of column 2 of the Assyrian version correspond to lines 174-177 of the Pennsylvania tablet, and lines 44-50 to lines 192-221. It would seem that Gish proceeds stealthily at night to go to the goddess Ishhara, who lies on a couch in the _bt muti_ , the "family house" Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 2. 46-48). He encounters Enkidu in the street, and the latter blocks Gish's path, puts his foot in the gate leading to the house where the goddess is, and thus prevents Gish from entering. Thereupon the two have a fierce encounter in which Gish is worsted. The meaning of the episode itself is not clear. Does Enkidu propose to deprive Gish, here viewed as a god (cf. line 190 of the Pennsylvania tablet = Assyrian version, Tablet I, 4, 45, "like a god"), of his spouse, the goddess Ishhara--another form of Ishtar? Or are the two heroes, the one a counterpart of the other, contesting for the possession of a goddess? Is it in this scene that Enkidu becomes the "rival" (_me-ih-r_, line 191 of the Pennsylvania tablet) of the divine Gish? We must content ourself with having obtained through the Pennsylvania tablet a clearer indication of the occasion of the fight between the two heroes, and leave the further explanation of the episode till a fortunate chance may throw additional light upon it. There is perhaps a reference to the episode in the Assyrian version, Tablet II, 3b, 35-36. Line 196. For _i-na-ag-s-am_ (from _nagsu_), Langdon proposes the purely fanciful "embracing her in sleep," whereas it clearly means "he approaches." Cf. Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, page 645a. Lines 197-200 appear to correspond to Tablet IV, 2, 35-37, of the Assyrian version, though not forming a complete parallel. We may therefore supply at the beginning of line 35 of the Assyrian version _[ittaziz] Enkidu_, corresponding to line 197 of the Pennsylvania tablet. Line 36 of IV, 2, certainly appears to correspond to line 200 (_dan-nu-ti_ = _da-na-ni-is-s_). Line 208. The first sign looks more like _sar_, though _ur_ is possible. Line 211 is clearly a description of Enkidu, as is shown by a comparison with the Assyrian version I, 2, 37: _[pi]-ti-ik pi-ir-ti-s uh-tan-na-ba kima d_Nidaba, "The form of his hair sprouted like wheat." We must therefore supply Enkidu in the preceding line. Tablet IV, 4, 6, of the Assyrian version also contains a reference to the flowing hair of Enkidu. Line 212. For the completion of the line cf. Harper, _Assyrian and
Babylonian Letters_, No. 214. Line 214. For _ribtu mti_ see the note above to line 28 of column 1. Lines 215-217 correspond almost entirely to the Assyrian version IV, 2, 46-48. The variations _ki-ib-su_ in place of _spu_, and _kima lm_, "like oxen," instead of _ina bb muti_ (repeated from line 46), _ana surbi_ for _ribam_, are slight though interesting. The Assyrian version shows that the "gate" in line 215 is "the gate of the family house" in which the goddess Ishhara lies. Lines 218-228. The detailed description of the fight between the two heroes is only partially preserved in the Assyrian version. Line 218. _li-i-im_ is evidently to be taken as plural here as in line 224, just as _su-ki-im_ (lines 27 and 175), _ri-bi-tim_ (lines 4, 28, etc.), _tarbasim_ (line 74), _assamim_ (line 98) are plural forms. Our text furnishes, as does also the Yale tablet, an interesting illustration of the vacillation in the Hammurabi period in the twofold use of _im_: (a) as an indication of the plural (as in Hebrew), and (b) as a mere emphatic ending (lines 63, 73, and 232), which becomes predominant in the post-Hammurabi age. Line 227. Gilgamesh is often represented on seal cylinders as kneeling, e.g., Ward Seal Cylinders Nos. 159, 160, 165. Cf. also Assyrian version V, 3, 6, where Gilgamesh is described as kneeling, though here in prayer. See further the commentary to the Yale tablet, line 215. Line 229. We must of course read _uz-za-s_, "his anger," and not _us-sa-s_, "his javelin," as Langdon does, which gives no sense. Line 231. Langdon's note is erroneous. He again misses the point. The stem of the verb here as in line 230 (_i-ni-ih_) is the common _nhu_, used so constantly in connection with _pashu_, to designate the cessation of anger. Line 234. _istn_ applied to Gish designates him of course as "unique," not as "an ordinary man," as Langdon supposes. Line 236. On this title "wild cow of the stall" for Ninsun, see Poebel in _OLZ_ 1914, page 6, to whom we owe the correct view regarding the name of Gilgamesh's mother. Line 238. _mu-ti_ here cannot mean "husband," but "man" in general. See above note to line 107. Langdon's strange misreading _ri-es-su_ for _ri-es-ka_ ("thy head") leads him again to miss the point, namely that Enkidu comforts his rival by telling him that he is destined for a career above that of the ordinary man. He is to be more than a mere prize fighter; he is to be a king, and no doubt in the ancient sense, as the representative of the deity. This is indicated by the statement that the kingship is decreed for him by Enlil. Similarly, Hu(m)baba or Huwawa is designated by Enlil to inspire terror among men (Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 5, 2 and 5), _i-sim-s d_Enlil = Yale tablet, l. 137, where this is to be supplied. This position accorded to Enlil is an important index for the origin of the Epic, which is thus shown to date from a period when the patron deity of Nippur was acknowledged as the general head of the pantheon. This justifies us in going back several centuries at least before Hammurabi for the beginning of the Gilgamesh story. If it had originated in the Hammurabi period,
we should have had Marduk introduced instead of Enlil. Line 242. As has been pointed out in the corrections to the text (Appendix), _s-tu-ur_ can only be III, 1, from _atru_, "to be in excess of." It is a pity that the balance of the line is broken off, since this is the first instance of a colophon beginning with the term in question. In some way _sutr_ must indicate that the copy of the text has been "enlarged." It is tempting to fill out the line _s-tu-ur e-li [duppi labiri]_, and to render "enlarged from an original," as an indication of an independent recension of the Epic in the Hammurabi period. All this, however, is purely conjectural, and we must patiently hope for more tablets of the Old Babylonian version to turn up. The chances are that some portions of the same edition as the Yale and Pennsylvania tablets are in the hands of dealers at present or have been sold to European museums. The war has seriously interfered with the possibility of tracing the whereabouts of groups of tablets that ought never to have been separated.

I will let the land hear (that)        I am determined to lure (him) in the cedar (forest) [155].        A name I will establish."        The elders of Erech of the plazas        brought word to Gish:        "Thou art young, O Gish, and thy heart carries thee away.        Thou dost not know what thou proposest to do.        We hear that Huwawa is enraged.        Who has ever opposed his weapon?        To one [double hour] in the heart of the forest,        Who has ever penetrated into it?

        To advance towards the dwelling (?) of Huwawa?"        Gish heard the report of his counsellors.        He saw and cried out to [his] friend:        "Now, my friend, thus [I speak].        I fear him, but [I will go to the cedar forest(?)];        I will go [with thee to the cedar forest].

[Enkidu] opened his mouth and spoke to Gish:        "[Since thou art resolved] to take the road.        Thy heart [be not afraid,] trust to me!        [Confide] to my hand his dwelling(?)!"

Lines 13-14 (also line 16). See for the restoration, lines 112-13. Line 62. For the restoration, see Jensen, p. 146 (Tablet III, 2a,9.) Lines 64-66. Restored on the basis of the Assyrian version, _ib_. line 10. Line 72. Cf. Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 4, 10, and restore at the end of this line _di-im-tam_ as in our text, instead of Jensen's conjecture.
Lines 74, 77 and 83. The restoration _zar-bis_, suggested by the Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 4, 4. Lines 76 and 82. Cf. Assyrian version, Tablet VIII, 3, 18. Line 78. _(-ta-ab-bil_ from _ablu_, "grieve" or "darkened." Cf. _us-ta-kal_ (Assyrian version, _ib_. line 9), where, perhaps, we are to restore _it-ta-[bil pa-ni-s]_. Line 87. _us-ta-li-pa_ from _elpu_, "exhaust." See Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 49a. Line 89. Cf. Assyrian version, _ib_. line 11, and restore the end of the line there to _i-ni-is_, as in our text. Line 96. For _dapinu_ as an epithet of Huwawa, see Assyrian version, Tablet III, 2a, 17, and 3a, 12. _Dapinu_ occurs also as a description of an ox (Rm 618, Bezold, _Catalogue of the Kouyunjik Tablets_, etc., p. 1627). Line 98. The restoration on the basis of _ib._ III, 2a, 18. Lines 96-98 may possibly form a parallel to _ib_. lines 17-18, which would then read about as follows: "Until I overcome Huwawa, the terrible, and all the evil in the land I shall have destroyed." At the same time, it is possible that we are to restore _[lu-ul]-li-ik_ at the end of line 98. Line 101. _lilissu_ occurs in the Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 6, 36. Line 100. For _halbu_, "jungle," see Assyrian version, Tablet V, 3, 39 (p. 160). Lines 109-111. These lines enable us properly to restore Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 5, 3 = Haupt's edition, p. 83 (col. 5, 3). No doubt the text read as ours _mu-tum_ (or _mu-u-tum_) _na-pis-su_. Line 115. _supatu_, which occurs again in line 199 and also line 275._s-pa-as-su_ (= _supat-su_) must have some such meaning as "dwelling," demanded by the context. [Dhorme refers me to _OLZ_ 1916, p. 145]. Line 129. Restored on the basis of the Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 6, 38. Line 131. The restoration _muktablu_, tentatively suggested on the basis of CT XVIII, 30, 7b, where _muktablu_, "warrior," appears as one of the designations of Gilgamesh, followed by _a-lik pa-na_, "the one who goes in advance," or "leader"--the phrase so constantly used in the Huwawa episode. Line 132. Cf. Assyrian version, Tablet I, 5, 18-19. Lines 136-137. These two lines restored on the basis of Jensen IV, 5, 2 and 5. The variant in the Assyrian version, _s nise_ (written Ukumes in one case and Lumes in the other), for the numeral 7 in our text to designate a terror of the largest and most widespread character, is interesting. The number 7 is similarly used as a designation of Gilgamesh, who is called _Esigga imin_, "seven-fold strong," i.e.,
supremely strong (CT XVIII, 30, 6-8). Similarly, Enkidu, _ib._ line 10, is designated _a-r imina_, "seven-fold." Line 149. A difficult line because of the uncertainty of the reading at the beginning of the following line. The most obvious meaning of _mi-it-tu_ is "corpse," though in the Assyrian version _salamtu_ is used (Assyrian version, Tablet V, 2, 42). On the other hand, it is possible--as Dr. Lutz suggested to me--that _mittu_, despite the manner of writing, is identical with _mitt_, the name of a divine weapon, well-known from the Assyrian creation myth (Tablet IV, 130), and other passages. The combination _mit-tu s-ku--_, "lofty weapon," in the Bilingual text IV, R2, 18 No. 3, 31-32, would favor the meaning "weapon" in our passage, since _[s]-ku-tu_ is a possible restoration at the beginning of line 150. However, the writing _mi-it-ti_ points too distinctly to a derivative of the stem _mtu_, and until a satisfactory explanation of lines 150-152 is forthcoming, we must stick to the meaning "corpse" and read the verb _il-ku-ut_. Line 152. The context suggests "lion" for the puzzling _la-bu_. Line 156. Another puzzling line. Dr. Clay's copy is an accurate reproduction of what is distinguishable. At the close of the line there appears to be a sign written over an erasure. Line 158. _[ga-ti lu-]us-kun_ as in line 186, literally, "I will place my hand," i.e., I purpose, I am determined. Line 160. The restoration on the basis of the parallel line 187. Note the interesting phrase, "writing a name" in the sense of acquiring "fame." Line 161. The _kiskatt_, "artisans," are introduced also in the Assyrian version, Tablet VI, 187, to look at the enormous size and weight of the horns of the slain divine bull. See for other passages Muss-Arnolt _Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 450b. At the beginning of this line, we must seek for the same word as in line 163. Line 162. While the restoration _bel_, "weapon," is purely conjectural, the context clearly demands some such word. I choose _bel_ in preference to _kakk_, in view of the Assyrian version, Tablet VI, 1. Line 163. _Putuku_ (or _putukku_) from _patku_ would be an appropriate word for the fabrication of weapons. Line 165. The _rabtim_ here, as in line 167, I take as the "master mechanics" as contrasted with the _ummianu_, "common workmen," or journeymen. A parallel to this forging of the weapons for the two heroes is to be found in the Sumerian fragment of the Gilgamesh Epic published by Langdon, _Historical and Religious Texts from the Temple Library of Nippur_ (Munich, 1914), No. 55, 1-15. Lines 168-170 describe the forging of the various parts of the lances for the two heroes. The _sipru_ is the spear point Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 886b; the _isid patri_ is clearly the "hilt," and the _meselitum_ I therefore take as the "blade" proper. The word occurs here for the first time, so far as I can see. For 30 minas, see Assyrian version, Tablet VI, 189, as the weight of the two horns of the divine bull. Each axe weighing 3 _biltu_, and the lance with
point and hilt 3 _biltu_ we would have to assume 4 _biltu_ for each _pasu_, so as to get a total of 10 _biltu_ as the weight of the weapons for each hero. The lance is depicted on seal cylinders representing Gilgamesh and Enkidu, for example, Ward, _Seal Cylinders_, No. 199, and also in Nos. 184 and 191 in the field, with the broad hilt; and in an enlarged form in No. 648. Note the clear indication of the hilt. The two figures are Gilgamesh and Enkidu--not two Gilgameshes, as Ward assumed. See above, page 34. A different weapon is the club or mace, as seen in Ward, Nos. 170 and 173. This appears also to be the weapon which Gilgamesh holds in his hand on the colossal figure from the palace of Sargon (Jastrow, _Civilization of Babylonia and Assyria_, Pl. LVII), though it has been given a somewhat grotesque character by a perhaps intentional approach to the scimitar, associated with Marduk (see Ward, _Seal Cylinders_, Chap. XXVII). The exact determination of the various weapons depicted on seal-cylinders merits a special study. Line 181. Begins a speech of Huwawa, extending to line 187, reported to Gish by the elders (line 188-189), who add a further warning to the youthful and impetuous hero. Line 183. _lu-uk-s-su_ (also l. 186), from _aksu_, "drive on" or "lure on," occurs on the Pennsylvania tablet, line 135, _uk-ki-si_, "lure on" or "entrap," which Langdon erroneously renders "take away" and thereby misses the point completely. See the comment to the line of the Pennsylvania tablet in question. Line 192. On the phrase _san bunu_, "change of countenance," in the sense of "enraged," see the note to the Pennsylvania tablet, l.31. Line 194. _nu-ma-at_ occurs in a tablet published by Meissner, _Altbabyl. Privatrecht_, No. 100, with _bt abi_, which shows that the total confine of a property is meant; here, therefore, the "interior" of the forest or heart. It is hardly a "by-form" of _nuptum_ as Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 690b, and others have supposed, though _nu-um-tum_ in one passage quoted by Muss-Arnolt, _ib._ p. 705a, may have arisen from an aspirate pronunciation of the _p_ in _nubtum_. Line 215. The kneeling attitude of prayer is an interesting touch. It symbolizes submission, as is shown by the description of Gilgamesh's defeat in the encounter with Enkidu (Pennsylvania tablet, l. 227), where Gilgamesh is represented as forced to "kneel" to the ground. Again in the Assyrian version, Tablet V, 4, 6, Gilgamesh kneels down (though the reading _ka-mis_ is not certain) and has a vision. Line 229. It is much to be regretted that this line is so badly preserved, for it would have enabled us definitely to restore the opening line of the Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh Epic. The fragment published by Jeremias in his appendix to his _Izdubar-Nimrod_, Plate IV, gives us the end of the colophon line to the Epic, reading ......... _di ma-a-ti_ (cf. _ib._, Pl. I, 1.  ... _a-ti_). Our text evidently reproduces the same phrase and enables us to supply _ka_, as well as the name of the hero Gish of which there are distinct traces. The missing word, therefore, describes the hero as the ruler, or controller of the land. But what are the two signs before _ka_? A participial form from _pakdu_, which one naturally thinks of, is impossible because of the _ka_, and for the same reason one cannot supply the word for shepherd (_nakidu_). One might think of _ka-ak-ka-du_, except that _kakkadu_ is not used for "head" in the sense of "chief" of the land. I venture to restore _[i-ik-]ka-di_,
"strong one." Our text at all events disposes of Haupt's conjecture _is-di ma-a-ti_ (_JAOS_ 22, p. 11), "Bottom of the earth," as also of Ungnad's proposed _[a-di pa]-a-ti_, "to the ends" (Ungnad-Gressmann, _Gilgamesch-Epos_, p. 6, note), or a reading _di-ma-a-ti_, "pillars." The first line of the Assyrian version would now read
        _s nak-ba i-mu-ru [d_Gis-gi(n)-mas i-ik-ka]-di ma-a-ti,
i.e., "The one who saw everything, Gilgamesh the strong one (?) of the land." We may at all events be quite certain that the name of the hero occurred in the first line and that he was described by some epithet indicating his superior position. Lines 229-235 are again an address of Gilgamesh to the sun-god, after having received a favorable "oracle" from the god (line 222). The hero promises to honor and to celebrate the god, by erecting thrones for him. Lines 237-244 describe the arming of the hero by the "master" craftsman. In addition to the _pasu_ and _patru_, the bow (?) and quiver are given to him. Line 249 is paralleled in the new fragment of the Assyrian version published by King in _PSBA_ 1914, page 66 (col. 1, 2), except that this fragment adds _gi-mir_ to _e-mu-ki-ka_. Lines 251-252 correspond to column 1, 6-8, of King's fragment, with interesting variations "battle" and "fight" instead of "way" and "road," which show that in the interval between the old Babylonian and the Assyrian version, the real reason why Enkidu should lead the way, namely, because he knows the country in which Huwawa dwells (lines 252-253), was supplemented by describing Enkidu also as being more experienced in battle than Gilgamesh. Line 254. I am unable to furnish a satisfactory rendering for this line, owing to the uncertainty of the word at the end. Can it be "his household," from the stem which in Hebrew gives us MISEPOHOH "family?" Line 255. Is paralleled by col. 1, 4, of King's new fragment. The episode of Gish and Enkidu proceeding to Ninsun, the mother of Gish, to obtain her counsel, which follows in King's fragment, appears to have been omitted in the old Babylonian version. Such an elaboration of the tale is exactly what we should expect as it passed down the ages. Line 257. Our text shows that _irnittu_ (lines 257, 264, 265) means primarily "endeavor," and then success in one's endeavor, or "triumph." Lines 266-270. Do not appear to refer to rites performed after a victory, as might at a first glance appear, but merely voice the hope that Gish will completely take possession of Huwawa's territory, so as to wash up after the fight in Huwawa's own stream; and the hope is also expressed that he may find pure water in Huwawa's land in abundance, to offer a libation to Shamash.
Line 275. _On s-pa-as-su_ = _supat-su_, see above, to l. 115.
[Note on Sabitum (above, p. 11) In a communication before the Oriental Club of Philadelphia (Feb. 10, 1920), Prof. Haupt made the suggestion that _sa-bi-tum_ (or _tu_), hitherto regarded as a proper name, is an epithet describing the woman who dwells at the seashore which Gilgamesh in the course of his wanderings reaches, as an "innkeeper". It is noticeable that the term always appears without the determinative placed before proper names; and since in the old Babylonian version (so far as preserved) and in the Assyrian version, the determinative is invariably used, its consistent absence in the case of _sabitum_ (Assyrian Version, Tablet X, 1, 1, 10, 15, 20; 2, 15-16 [_sa-bit_]; Meissner fragment col. 2, 11-12) speaks in favor of Professor Haupt's suggestion. The meaning "innkeeper", while not as yet found in Babylonian-Assyrian literature is most plausible, since we have _sabu_ as a general name for 'drink', though originally designating perhaps more specifically sesame wine (Muss-Arnolt, Assyrian Dictionary, p. 745b) or distilled brandy, according to Prof. Haupt. Similarly, in the Aramaic dialects, _se_bha is used for "to drink" and in the Pael to "furnish drink". Muss-Arnolt in his Assyrian Dictionary, 746b, has also recognized that _sabitum_ was originally an epithet and compares the Aramaic _se_bhoyth(p1) "barmaids". In view of the bad reputation of inns in ancient Babylonia as brothels, it would be natural for an epithet like _sabitum_ to become the equivalent to "public" women, just as the inn was a "public" house. Sabitum would, therefore, have the same force as _samhatu_ (the "harlot"), used in the Gilgamesh Epic by the side of _harimtu_ "woman" (see the note to line 46 of Pennsylvania Tablet). The Sumerian term for the female innkeeper is Sal Gestinna "the woman of the wine," known to us from the Hammurabi Code 108-111. The bad reputation of inns is confirmed by these statutes, for the house of the Sal Gestinna is a gathering place for outlaws. The punishment of a female devotee who enters the "house of a wine woman" (bt Sal Gestinna 110) is death. It was not "prohibition" that prompted so severe a punishment, but the recognition of the purpose for which a devotee would enter such a house of ill repute. The speech of the _sabitum_ or innkeeper to Gilgamesh (above, p. 12) was, therefore, an invitation to stay with her, instead of seeking for life elsewhere. Viewed as coming from a "public woman" the address becomes significant. The invitation would be parallel to the temptation offered by the _harimtu_ in the first tablet of the Enkidu, and to which Enkidu succumbs. The incident in the tablet would, therefore, form a parallel in the adventures of Gilgamesh to the one that originally belonged to the Enkidu cycle. Finally, it is quite possible that _sabitum_ is actually the Akkadian equivalent of the Sumerian Sal Gestinna, though naturally until this equation is confirmed by a syllabary or by other direct evidence, it remains a conjecture. See now also Albright's remarks on Sabitum in the A. J. S. L. 36, pp. 269 _seq._]
CORRECTIONS TO THE TEXT OF LANGDON'S EDITION OF THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET. [157]
Column 1.
5. Read _it-lu-tim_ ("heroes") instead of _id-da-tim_ ("omens"). 6. Read _ka-ka-bu_ instead of _ka-ka-'a_. This disposes of Langdon's note 2 on p. 211. 9 Read _-ni-is-s-ma_, "I became weak" (from _ensu_, "weak") instead of _ilam is-s-ma_, "He bore a net"(!). This disposes of Langdon's note 5 on page 211. 10. Read _Urukki_ instead of _ad-ki_. Langdon's note 7 is wrong. 12. Langdon's note 8 is wrong. _-um-mid-ma pu-ti_ does not mean "he attained my front." 14. Read _ab-ba-la-s-s_ instead of _at-ba-la-s-s_. 15. Read _mu-di-a-at_ instead of _mu-u-da-a-at_. 20. Read _ta-ha-du_ instead of an impossible _[sa]-ah-ha-ta_--two mistakes in one word. Supply _kima Sal_ before _tahadu_. 22. Read _s-s_ instead of _s_; and at the end of the line read _[tu-ut]-tu--ma_ instead of _s--zu_. 23. Read _ta-tar-ra-[as-su]_. 24. Read _[us]-ti-nim-ma_ instead of _[is]-ti-lam-ma_. 28. Read at the beginning _s_ instead of _ina_. 29. Langdon's text and transliteration of the first word do not tally. Read _ha-as-si-nu_, just as in line 31. 32. Read _ah-ta-du_ ("I rejoiced") instead of _ah-ta-ta_.
Column 2.
4. Read at the end of the line _di-da-s(?) ip-t-[e]_ instead of _Di-?-al-lu-un_ (!). 5. Supply _d_En-ki-du at the beginning. Traces point to this reading. 19. Read _[gi]-it-ma-[lu]_ after _d_Gis, as suggested by the Assyrian version, Tablet I, 4, 38, where _emku_ ("strength") replaces _nepistu_ of our text. 20. Read _at-[ta kima Sal ta-ha]-bu-[ub]-s_. 21. Read _ta-[ra-am-s ki-ma]_. 23. Read as one word _ma-a-ag-ri-i-im_ ("accursed"), spelled in characteristic Hammurabi fashion, instead of dividing into two words
_ma-a-ak_ and _ri-i-im_, as Langdon does, who suggests as a translation "unto the place yonder(?) of the shepherd"(!). 24. Read _im-ta-har_ instead of _im-ta-gar_. 32. Supply _ili_(?) after _ki-ma_. 33. Read _s-ri-i-im_ as one word. 35. Read _i-na [s]-ri-s [im]-hu-ru_. 36. Traces at beginning point to either __ or _ki_ (= _itti_). Restoration of lines 36-39 (perhaps to be distributed into five lines) on the basis of the Assyrian version, Tablet I, 4, 2-5.
Column 3.
14. Read _Ks_ (= _sikaram_, "wine") _si-ti_, "drink," as in line 17, instead of _bi-is-ti_, which leads Langdon to render this perfectly simple line "of the conditions and the fate of the land"(!). 21. Read _it-tam-ru_ instead of _it-ta-bir-ru_. 22. Supply _[l_S]-I. 29. Read _-gi-ir-ri_ from _gar_ ("attack), instead of separating into __ and _gi-ir-ri_, as Langdon does, who translates "and the lion." The sign used can _never_ stand for the copula! Nor is _girru_, "lion!" 30. Read _Sbmes_, "shepherds," instead of _sab-[si]-es_! 31. _sib-ba-ri_ is not "mountain goat," nor can _ut-tap-pi-is_ mean "capture." The first word means "dagger," and the second "he drew out." 33. Read _it-ti-[lu] na-ki-[di-e]_, instead of _itti immer nakie_ which yields no sense. Langdon's rendering, even on the basis of his reading of the line, is a grammatical monstrosity. 35. Read _gis_ instead of _wa_. 37. Read perhaps _a-na [na-ki-di-e i]- za-ak-ki-ir_.
Column 4.
4. The first sign is clearly _iz_, not _ta_, as Langdon has it in note 1 on page 216. 9. The fourth sign is _su_, not _s_. 10. Separate _e-es_ ("why") from the following. Read _ta-hi-[il]_, followed, perhaps, by _la_. The last sign is not certain; it may be _ma_.
11. Read _lim-nu_ instead of _mi-nu_. In the same line read _a-la-ku ma-na-ah-[ti]-ka_ instead of _a-la-ku-zu_(!) _na-ah ... ma_, which, naturally, Langdon cannot translate. 16. Read _e-lu-tim_ instead of _pa-a-ta-tim_. The first sign of the line, _tu_, is not certain, because apparently written over an erasure. The second sign may be _a_. Some one has scratched the tablet at this point. 18. Read _uk-la-at li_ (?) instead of _ug-ad-ad-lil_, which gives no possible sense!
Column 5.
2. Read _[wa]-ar-ki-s_. 8. Read _i-ta-wa-a_ instead of _i-ta-me-a_. The word _pi-it-tam_ belongs to line 9! The sign _pi_ is unmistakable. This disposes of note 1 on p. 218. 9. Read Mi = _salmu_, "image." This disposes of Langdon's note 2 on page 218. Of six notes on this page, four are wrong. 11. The first sign appears to be _si_ and the second _ma_. At the end we are perhaps to supply _[s-ki-i pu]-uk-ku-ul_, on the basis of the Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 2, 45, _s-ki-i pu-[uk-ku-ul]_. 12. Traces at end of line suggest _i-pa(?)-ka-du_. 13. Read _i-[na mti da-an e-mu]-ki i-wa_. 18. Read _ur-s-nu_ instead of _ip-s-nu_. 19. Read _i-s-ru_ instead of _i-tu-ru_. 24. The reading _it-ti_ after _d_Gis is suggested by the traces. 25. Read _in-ni-[ib-bi-it]_ at the end of the line. 28. Read _ip-ta-ra-[as a-la]-ak-tam_ at the end of the line, as in the Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 2, 37. 30. The conjectural restoration is based on the Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 2, 36.
Column 6.
3. Read _i-na si-ri-[s]_. 5. Supply _[il-li-ik]_. 21. Langdon's text has a superfluous _ga_.
22. Read _uz-za-s_, "his anger," instead of _us-sa-s_, "his javelin" (!). 23. Read _i-ni-ih i-ra-as-su_, i.e., "his breast was quieted," in the sense of "his anger was appeased." 31. Read _ri-es-ka_ instead of _ri-es-su_. In general, it should be noted that the indications of the number of lines missing at the bottom of columns 1-3 and at the top of columns 4-6 as given by Langdon are misleading. Nor should he have drawn any lines at the bottom of columns 1-3 as though the tablet were complete. Besides in very many cases the space indications of what is missing within a line are inaccurate. Dr. Langdon also omitted to copy the statement on the edge: _4 s-si_, i.e., "240 lines;" and in the colophon he mistranslates _s-tu-ur_, "written," as though from _satru_, "write," whereas the form is the permansive III, 1, of _atru_, "to be in excess of." The sign _tu_ never has the value _tu_! In all, Langdon has misread the text or mistransliterated it in over forty places, and of the 204 preserved lines he has mistranslated about one-half.

[1] See for further details of this royal library, Jastrow, _Civilization of Babylonia and Assyria_, p. 21 _seq_. [2] _Das Babylonische Nimrodepos_ (Leipzig, 1884-1891), supplemented by Haupt's article _Die Zwlfte Tafel des Babylonischen Nimrodepos_ in _BA_ I, pp. 48-79, containing the fragments of the twelfth tablet. The fragments of the Epic in Ashurbanapal's library--some sixty--represent portions of several copies. Sin-lik-unnini--perhaps from Erech, since this name appears as that of a family in tablets from Erech (see Clay, _Legal Documents from Erech_, Index, p. 73)--is named in a list of texts (K 9717--Haupt's edition No. 51, line 18) as the editor of the Epic, though probably he was not the only compiler. Since the publication of Haupt's edition, a few fragments were added by him as an appendix to Alfred Jeremias _Izdubar-Nimrod_ (Leipzig, 1891) Plates II-IV, and two more are embodied in Jensen's transliteration of all the fragments in the _Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek_ VI; pp. 116-265, with elaborate notes, pp. 421-531. Furthermore a fragment, obtained from supplementary excavations at Kouyunjik, has been published by L. W. King in his _Supplement to the Catalogue of the Cuneiform Tablets in the Kouyunjik Collection of the British Cuneiform Tablets in the Kouyunjik Collection of the British Museum_ No. 56 and _PSBA_ Vol. 36, pp. 64-68. Recently a fragment of the 6th tablet from the excavations at Assur has been published by Ebeling, _Keilschrifttexte aus Assur Religisen Inhalts_ No. 115, and one may expect further portions to turn up. The designation "Nimrod Epic" on the supposition that the hero of the Babylonian Epic is identical with Nimrod, the "mighty hunter" of Genesis 10, has now been generally abandoned, in the absence of any evidence that the Babylonian hero bore a name like Nimrod. For
all that, the description of Nimrod as the "mighty hunter" and the occurrence of a "hunter" in the Babylonian Epic (Assyrian version Tablet I)--though he is not the hero--points to a confusion in the Hebrew form of the borrowed tradition between Gilgamesh and Nimrod. The latest French translation of the Epic is by Dhorme, _Choix de Textes Religieux Assyro-Babyloniens_ (Paris, 1907), pp. 182-325; the latest German translation by Ungnad-Gressmann, _Das Gilgamesch-Epos_ (Gttingen, 1911), with a valuable analysis and discussion. These two translations now supersede Jensen's translation in the _Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek_, which, however, is still valuable because of the detailed notes, containing a wealth of lexicographical material. Ungnad also gave a partial translation in Gressmann-Ranke, _Altorientalische Texte and Bilder_ I, pp. 39-61. In English, we have translations of substantial portions by Muss-Arnolt in Harper's _Assyrian and Babylonian Literature_ (New York, 1901), pp. 324-368; by Jastrow, _Religion of Babylonia and Assyria_ (Boston, 1898), Chap. XXIII; by Clay in _Light on the Old Testament from Babel_, pp. 78-84; by Rogers in _Cuneiform Parallels to the Old Testament_, pp. 80-103; and most recently by Jastrow in _Sacred Books and Early Literature of the East_ (ed. C. F. Horne, New York, 1917), Vol. I, pp. 187-220. [3] See Luckenbill in _JAOS_, Vol. 37, p. 452 _seq._ Prof. Clay, it should be added, clings to the older reading, Hammurabi, which is retained in this volume. [4] _ZA_, Vol. 14, pp. 277-292. [5] The survivor of the Deluge is usually designated as Ut-napishtim in the Epic, but in one passage (Assyrian version, Tablet XI, 196), he is designated as Atra-hasis "the very wise one." Similarly, in a second version of the Deluge story, also found in Ashurbanapal's library (IV R2 additions, p. 9, line 11). The two names clearly point to two versions, which in accordance with the manner of ancient compositions were merged into one. See an article by Jastrow in _ZA_, Vol. 13, pp. 288-301. [6] Published by Scheil in _Recueil des Travaux_, etc. Vol. 20, pp. 55-58. [7] The text does not form part of the Gilgamesh Epic, as the colophon, differing from the one attached to the Epic, shows.

See Jastrow, _A Gentle Cynic_, p. 172 _seq._ [11] Among the Nippur tablets in the collection of the University of Pennsylvania Museum.

See also Poebel in the _Museum Journal_, Vol. IV, p. 47, and an article by Dr. Langdon in the same Journal, Vol. VII, pp. 178-181, though Langdon fails to credit Dr. Poebel with the discovery and publication of the important tablet.

[23] _Publications of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, Babylonian Section_, Vol. X, No. 3 (Philadelphia, 1917). It is to be regretted that Dr. Langdon should not have given full credit to Dr. Poebel for his discovery of the tablet. He merely refers in an obscure footnote to Dr. Poebel's having made a copy. [24] E.g., in the very first note on page 211, and again in a note on page 213. [25] Dr. Langdon neglected to copy the signs _4 s-si_ = 240 which appear on the edge of the tablet. He also misunderstood the word _s-tu-ur_ in the colophon which he translated "written," taking the word from a stem _satru_, "write." The form _s-tu-ur_ is III, 1, from _atru_, "to be in excess of," and indicates, presumably, that the text is a copy "enlarged" from an older original. See the Commentary to the colophon, p. 86. [26] _Museum Journal_, Vol. VIII, p. 29. [27] See below, p. 23. [28] I follow the enumeration of tablets, columns and lines in Jensen's edition, though some fragments appear to have been placed by him in a wrong position. [29] According to Bezold's investigation, _Verbalsuffixformen als Alterskriterien babylonisch-assyrischer Inschriften_ (Heidelberg
Akad. d. Wiss., Philos.-Histor. Klasse, 1910, 9te Abhandlung), the bulk of the tablets in Ashurbanapal's library are copies of originals dating from about 1500 B.C. It does not follow, however, that all the copies date from originals of the same period. Bezold reaches the conclusion on the basis of various forms for verbal suffixes, that the fragments from the Ashurbanapal Library actually date from three distinct periods ranging from before c. 1450 to c. 700 B.C. [30] "Before thou comest from the mountain, Gilgamesh in Erech will see thy dreams," after which the dreams are recounted by the woman to Enkidu. The expression "thy dreams" means here "dreams about thee." (Tablet I, 5, 23-24). [31] Lines 100-101. [32] In a paper read before the American Oriental Society at New Haven, April 4, 1918. [33] See the commentary to col. 4 of the Yale tablet for further details. [34] This is no doubt the correct reading of the three signs which used to be read Iz-tu-bar or Gish-du-bar. The first sign has commonly the value Gish, the second can be read Gin or Gi (Brnnow No. 11900) and the third Mash as well as Bar. See Ungnad in Ungnad-Gressmann, _Das Gilgamesch-Epos_, p. 76, and Poebel, _Historical and Grammatical Texts_, p. 123. [35] So also in Sumerian (Zimmern, _Sumerische Kultlieder aus altbabylonischer Zeit_, No. 196, rev. 14 and 16.) [36] The sign used, LUM (Brnnow No. 11183), could have the value hu as well as hum. [37] The addition "father-in-law of Moses" to the name Hobab b. Re'uel in this passage must refer to Re'uel, and not to Hobab. In Judges 4, 11, the gloss "of the Bene Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses" must be separated into two: (1) "Bene Hobab," and (2) "father-in-law of Moses." The latter addition rests on an erroneous tradition, or is intended as a brief reminder that Hobab is identical with the son of Re'uel. [38] See his _List of Personal Names from the Temple School of Nippur_, p. 122. _Hu-um-ba-bi-tu_ and _si-kin hu-wa-wa_ also occur in Omen Texts (_CT_ XXVII, 4, 8-9 = Pl. 3, 17 = Pl. 6, 3-4 = _CT_ XXVIII, 14, 12). The contrast to _huwawa_ is _ligru_, "dwarf" (_CT_ XXVII, 4, 12 and 14 = Pl. 6, 7.9 = Pl. 3, 19). See Jastrow, _Religion Babyloniens und Assyriens_, II, p. 913, Note 7. Huwawa, therefore, has the force of "monster." [39] Ungnad-Gressmann, _Das Gilgamesch-Epos_, p. 111 _seq._ [40] Ungnad, 1. c. p. 77, called attention to this name, but failed to draw the conclusion that Hu(m)baba therefore belongs to the West and not to the East. [41] First pointed out by Ungnad in _OLZ_ 1910, p. 306, on the basis of _CT_ XVIII, 30, 10, where En-gi-d appears in the column furnishing _phonetic_ readings.
[42] See Clay _Amurru_, pp. 74, 129, etc. [43] Tablet I, 2, 39-40; 3, 6-7 and 33-34; 4, 3-4. [44] Tablet I, 2, 1 and IX, 2, 16. Note also the statement about Gilgamesh that "his body is flesh of the gods" (Tablet IX, 2, 14; X, 1, 7). [45] _BOR_ IV, p. 264. [46] Lewin, _Die Scholien des Theodor bar Koni zur Patriarchengeschichte_ (Berlin, 1905), p. 2. See Gressmann in Ungnad-Gressmann, _Das Gilgamesch-Epos_, p. 83, who points out that the first element of GLMGVS compared with the second of GMYGMVS gives the exact form that we require, namely, Gilgamos. [47] Tablet I, col. 2, is taken up with this episode. [48] See Poebel, _Historical and Grammatical Texts_, p. 123. [49] See Poebel, _Historical Texts_ No. 2, col. 2, 26.

Cf. also _CT_ XXV, 28(K 7659) 3, where we must evidently supply [Esigga]-tuk, for which in the following line we have again Gish-bil-ga-mesh as an equivalent. See Meissner, _OLZ_ 1910, 99. [52] See, e.g., Barton, _Haverford Collection_ II No. 27, Col. I, 14, etc. [53] Deimel, _Pantheon Babylonicum_, p. 95. [54] _CT_ XII, 50 (K 4359) obv. 17. [55] See Barton, _Origin and Development of Babylonian Writing_, II, p. 99 _seq._, for various explanations, though all centering around the same idea of the picture of fire in some form. [56] See the passages quoted by Poebel, _Historical and Grammatical Texts_, p. 126. [57] E.g., Genesis 4, 20, Jabal, "the father of tent-dwelling and cattle holding;" Jubal (4, 21), "the father of harp and pipe striking." [58] See particularly the plays (in the J. Document) upon the names of the twelve sons of Jacob, which are brought forward either as tribal characteristics, or as suggested by some incident or utterance by the mother at the birth of each son. [59] The designation is variously explained by Arabic writers. See Beidhawi's _Commentary_ (ed. Fleischer), to Sra 18, 82. [60] The writing Gish-gi-mash as an approach to the pronunciation Gilgamesh would thus represent the beginning of the artificial process which seeks to interpret the first syllable as "hero."
[61] See above, p. 27. [62] Poebel, _Historical Texts_, p. 115 _seq_. [63] Many years ago (_BA_ III, p. 376) I equated Etana with Ethan in the Old Testament--therefore a West Semitic name. [64] See Clay, _The Empire of the Amorites_, p. 80. [65] Professor Clay strongly favors an Amoritic origin also for Gilgamesh. His explanation of the name is set forth in his recent work on _The Empire of the Amorites_, page 89, and is also referred to in his work on _Amurru_, page 79, and in his volume of _Miscellaneous Inscriptions in the Yale Babylonian Collection_, page 3, note. According to Professor Clay the original form of the hero's name was West Semitic, and was something like _Bilga-Mash_, the meaning of which was perhaps "the offspring of Mash." For the first element in this division of the name cf. Pilikam, the name of a ruler of an early dynasty, and Balak of the Old Testament. In view of the fact that the axe figures so prominently in the Epic as an instrument wielded by Gilgamesh, Professor Clay furthermore thinks it reasonable to assume that the name was interpreted by the Babylonian scribe as "the axe of Mash." In this way he would account for the use of the determinative for weapons, which is also the sign Gish, in the name. It is certainly noteworthy that the ideogram Gish-Tn in the later form of _Gish-Tn-mash_ = _pasu_, "axe," _CT_ XVI, 38:14b, etc. _Tun_ also = _pilaku_ "axe," _CT_ xii, 10:34b. Names with similar element (besides Pilikam) are Belaku of the Hammurabi period, Bilakku of the Cassite period, etc. It is only proper to add that Professor Jastrow assumes the responsibility for the explanation of the form and etymology of the name Gilgamesh proposed in this volume. The question is one in regard to which legitimate differences of opinion will prevail among scholars until through some chance a definite decision, one way or the other, can be reached. [66] _me-ih-r_ (line 191). [67] Tablet I, 5, 23. Cf. I, 3, 2 and 29. [68] Tablet IV, 4, 7 and I, 5, 3. [69] Assyrian version, Tablet II, 3b 34, in an address of Shamash to Enkidu. [70] So Assyrian version, Tablet VIII, 3, 11. Also supplied VIII, 5, 20 and 21; and X, 1, 46-47 and 5, 6-7. [71] Tablet XII, 3, 25. [72] Ward, _Seal Cylinders of Western Asia_, Chap. X, and the same author's _Cylinders and other Ancient Oriental Seals_--Morgan collection Nos. 19-50. [73] E.g., Ward No. 192, Enkidu has human legs like Gilgamesh; also No. 189, where it is difficult to say which is Gilgamesh, and which is Enkidu. The clothed one is probably Gilgamesh, though not infrequently Gilgamesh is also represented as nude, or merely with
a girdle around his waist. [74] E.g., Ward, Nos. 173, 174, 190, 191, 195 as well as 189 and 192. [75] On the other hand, in Ward Nos. 459 and 461, the conflict between the two heroes is depicted with the heroes distinguished in more conventional fashion, Enkidu having the hoofs of an animal, and also with a varying arrangement of beard and hair. [76] See Jastrow, _Religion of Babylonia and Assyria_ (Boston, 1898), p. 468 _seq._ [77] Ungnad-Gressmann, _Das Gilgamesch-Epos_, p. 90 _seq._ [78] Pennsylvania tablet, l. 198 = Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 2, 37. [79] "Enkidu blocked the gate" (Pennsylvania tablet, line 215) = Assyrian version Tablet IV, 2, 46: "Enkidu interposed his foot at the gate of the family house." [80] Pennsylvania tablet, lines 218 and 224. [81] Yale tablet, line 198; also to be supplied lines 13-14. [82] Yale tablet, lines 190 and 191. [83] _PSBA_ 1914, 65 _seq._ = Jensen III, 1a, 4-11, which can now be completed and supplemented by the new fragment. [84] I.e., Enkidu will save Gilgamesh. [85] These two lines impress one as popular sayings--here applied to Enkidu. [86] King's fragment, col. I, 13-27, which now enables us to complete Jensen III, 1a, 12-21. [87] Yale tablet, lines 252-253. [88] Yale tablet, lines 143-148 = Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 6, 26 _seq._ [89] Assyrian version, Tablet III, 2a, 13-14. [90] Lines 215-222. [91] Assyrian version, Tablet V, Columns 3-4. We have to assume that in line 13 of column 4 (Jensen, p. 164), Enkidu takes up the thread of conversation, as is shown by line 22: "Enkidu brought his dream to him and spoke to Gilgamesh." [92] Assyrian version, Tablet VI, lines 146-147. [93] Lines 178-183. [94] Lines 176-177. [95] Tablet VII, Column 6.
[96] Assyrian version, Tablet VI, 200-203. These words are put into the mouth of Gilgamesh (lines 198-199). It is, therefore, unlikely that he would sing his own praise. Both Jensen and Ungnad admit that Enkidu is to be supplied in at least one of the lines. [97] Lines 109 and 112. [98] Assyrian version, Tablet IX, 1, 8-9. [99] Tablet VIII, 5, 2-6. [100] So also Gressmann in Ungnad-Gressmann, _Das Gilgamesch-Epos_, p. 97, regards Enkidu as the older figure. [101] See Jastrow, _Adam and Eve in Babylonian Literature, AJSL_, Vol. 15, pp. 193-214. [102] Assyrian version, Tablet I, 2, 31-36. [103] It will be recalled that Enkidu is always spoken of as "born in the field." [104] Note the repetition _ibtani_ "created" in line 33 of the "man of Anu" and in line 35 of the offspring of Ninib. The creation of the former is by the "heart," i.e., by the will of Aruru, the creation of the latter is an act of moulding out of clay. [105] Tablet I, Column 3. [106] Following as usual the enumeration of lines in Jensen's edition. [107] An analogy does not involve a dependence of one tale upon the other, but merely that both rest on similar traditions, which _may_ have arisen independently. [108] Note that the name of Eve is not mentioned till after the fall (Genesis 3, 20). Before that she is merely _ishsha_, i.e., "woman," just as in the Babylonian tale the woman who guides Enkidu is _harimtu_, "woman." [109] "And he drank and became drunk" (Genesis 9, 21). [110] "His heart became glad and his face shone" (Pennsylvania Tablet, lines 100-101). [111] That in the combination of this Enkidu with tales of primitive man, inconsistent features should have been introduced, such as the union of Enkidu with the woman as the beginning of a higher life, whereas the presence of a hunter and his father shows that human society was already in existence, is characteristic of folk-tales, which are indifferent to details that may be contradictory to the general setting of the story. [112] Pennsylvania tablet, lines 102-104. [113] Line 105. [114] Tablet I, 1, 9. See also the reference to the wall of Erech as an "old construction" of Gilgamesh, in the inscription of An-Am in
the days of Sin-gamil (Hilprecht, _Old Babylonian Inscriptions_, I, No. 26.) Cf IV R2 52, 3, 53. [115] The invariable designation in the Assyrian version as against _Uruk ribtim_, "Erech of the plazas," in the old Babylonian version. [116] In Ungnad-Gressmann, _Das Gilgamesch-Epos_, p. 123 _seq._ [117] See Jensen, p. 266. Gilgamesh is addressed as "judge," as the one who inspects the divisions of the earth, precisely as Shamash is celebrated. In line 8 of the hymn in question, Gilgamesh is in fact addressed as Shamash. [118] The darkness is emphasized with each advance in the hero's wanderings (Tablet IX, col. 5). [119] This tale is again a nature myth, marking the change from the dry to the rainy season. The Deluge is an annual occurrence in the Euphrates Valley through the overflow of the two rivers. Only the canal system, directing the overflow into the fields, changed the curse into a blessing. In contrast to the Deluge, we have in the Assyrian creation story the drying up of the primeval waters so that the earth makes its appearance with the change from the rainy to the dry season. The world is created in the spring, according to the Akkadian view which is reflected in the Biblical creation story, as related in the P. document. See Jastrow, _Sumerian and Akkadian Views of Beginnings_ (_JAOS_, Vol 36, p. 295 seq.). [120] As-am in Sumerian corresponding to the Akkadian Sabatu, which conveys the idea of destruction. [121] The month is known as the "Mission of Ishtar" in Sumerian, in allusion to another nature myth which describes Ishtar's disappearance from earth and her mission to the lower world. [122] _Historical Texts_ No. 1. The Sumerian name of the survivor is Zi-u-gd-du or perhaps Zi-u-su-du (cf. King, _Legends of Babylon and Egypt_, p. 65, note 4), signifying "He who lengthened the day of life," i.e., the one of long life, of which Ut-napishtim ("Day of Life") in the Assyrian version seems to be an abbreviated Akkadian rendering, with the omission of the verb. So King's view, which is here followed. See also _CT_ XVIII, 30, 9, and Langdon, _Sumerian Epic of Paradise_, p. 90, who, however, enters upon further speculations that are fanciful. [123] See the translation in Ungnad-Gressmann, _Das Gilgamesch-Epos_, pp. 69, _seq._ and 73. [124] According to Professor Clay, quite certainly Amurru, just as in the case of Enkidu. [125] Gressmann in Ungnad-Gressmann, _Das Gilgamesch-Epos_, p. 100 _seq._ touches upon this _motif_, but fails to see the main point that the companions are also twins or at least brothers. Hence such examples as Abraham and Lot, David and Jonathan, Achilles and Patroclus, Eteokles and Polyneikes, are not parallels to Gilgamesh-Enkidu, but belong to the _enlargement_ of the _motif_ so as to include companions who are _not_ regarded as brothers.
[126] Or Romus. See Rendell Harris, l. c., p. 59, note 2. [127] One might also include the primeval pair Yama-Yami with their equivalents in Iranian mythology (Carnoy, _Iranian Mythology_, p. 294 _seq._). [128] Becoming, however, a triad and later increased to seven. Cf. Rendell Harris, l. c., p. 32. [129] I am indebted to my friend, Professor A. J. Carnoy, of the University of Louvain, for having kindly gathered and placed at my disposal material on the "twin-brother" _motif_ from Indo-European sources, supplemental to Rendell Harris' work. [130] On the other hand, _Uruk mtum_ for the district of Erech, i.e., the territory over which the city holds sway, appears in both versions (Pennsylvania tablet, 1. 10 = Assyrian version I, 5, 36). [131] "My likeness" (line 27). It should be noted, however, that lines 32-44 of I, 5, in Jensen's edition are part of a fragment K 9245 (not published, but merely copied by Bezold and Johns, and placed at Jensen's disposal), which may represent a _duplicate_ to I, 6, 23-34, with which it agrees entirely except for one line, viz., line 34 of K 9245 which is not found in column 6, 23-34. If this be correct, then there is lacking after line 31 of column 5, the interpretation of the dream given in the Pennsylvania tablet in lines 17-23. [132] _ina sap-li-ki_, literally, "below thee," whereas in the old Babylonian version we have _ana si-ri-ka_, "towards thee." [133] Repeated I, 6, 28. [134] _ul-tap-rid ki-is-su-s-ma_. The verb is from _pardu_, "violent." For _kissu_, "strong," see _CT_ XVI, 25, 48-49. Langdon (_Gilgamesh Epic_, p. 211, note 5) renders the phrase: "he shook his murderous weapon!!"--another illustration of his haphazard way of translating texts. [135] Shown by the colophon (Jeremias, _Izdubar-Nimrod_, Plate IV.) [136] Lines 42-43 must be taken as part of the narrative of the compiler, who tells us that after the woman had informed Enkidu that Gilgamesh already knew of Enkidu's coming through dreams interpreted by Ninsun, Gilgamesh actually set out and encountered Enkidu. [137] Tablet I, col. 4. See also above, p. 19. [138] IV, 2, 44-50. The word _ullanum_, (l.43) "once" or "since," points to the following being a reference to a former recital, and not an original recital. [139] Only the lower half (Haupt's edition, p. 82) is preserved. [140] "The eyes of Enkidu were filled with tears," corresponding to IV, 4, 10. [141] Unless indeed the number "seven" is a slip for the sign sa. See the commentary to the line.
[142] I.e., paid homage to the meteor. [143] I.e., the heroes of Erech raised me to my feet, or perhaps in the sense of "supported me." [144] I.e., Enkidu. [145] I.e., "thy way of life." [146] I.e., the man. [147] I.e., an idiomatic phrase meaning "for all times." [148] I.e., Enkidu became like Gish, godlike. Cf. col. 2, 11. [149] He was thrown and therefore vanquished. [150] Epithet given to Ninsun. See the commentary to the line. [151] Scribal error for _an_. [152] Text apparently _di_. [153] Hardly _ul_. [154] Omitted by scribe. [155] _Kisti_ omitted by scribe. [156] I.e., at night to thee, may Lugal-banda, etc. [157] The enumeration here is according to Langdon's edition.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Newby     Chief Executive and Director     gbnewby@pglaf.org Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate
Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.org This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

We encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an electronic path open for the next readers.  Do not remove this.
**Welcome To The World of Free Plain Vanilla Electronic Texts** **Etexts Readable By Both Humans and By Computers, Since 1971** *These Etexts Prepared By Hundreds of Volunteers and Donations* Information on contacting Project Gutenberg to get Etexts, and further information is included below.  We need your donations.
A Midsommer Nights Dreame by William Shakespeare July, 2000  [Etext #2242]
***The Project Gutenberg's Etext of Shakespeare's First Folio*** ********************A Midsommer Nights Dreame******************* *****This file should be named 0ws1710.txt or 0ws1710.zip****** Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 0ws1711.txt VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 0ws1710a.txt
Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions, all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing. Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement. The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a new copy has at least one byte more or less.
Information about Project Gutenberg (one page) We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+ If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year. The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion] This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users. At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person. We need your donations more than ever!
All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = CarnegieMellon University).

distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark. To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain works.

Project Gutenberg's Etext of Shakespeare's The first Part of Henry the Sixt
Executive Director's Notes: In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they are presented herein:  Barnardo. Who's there?  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold your selfe   Bar. Long liue the King *** As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u, above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . . The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day, as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend more on a wider selection of characters than they had to. You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available . . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes, that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous for signing his name with several different spellings. So, please take this into account when reading the comments below made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors that are "not" errors. . . . So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors, here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The first Part of Henry the Sixt. Michael S. Hart Project Gutenberg Executive Director

Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can come in ASCII to the printed text. The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling, punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a purer Shakespeare. Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is. The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different First Folio editions' best pages. If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com and davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this. David Reed A Midsommer Nights Dreame Actus primus. Enter Theseus, Hippolita, with others.  Theseus. Now faire Hippolita, our nuptiall houre Drawes on apace: foure happy daies bring in Another Moon: but oh, me thinkes, how slow This old Moon wanes; She lingers my desires Like to a Step-dame, or a Dowager, Long withering out a yong mans reuennew   Hip. Foure daies wil quickly steep the[m]selues in nights Foure nights wil quickly dreame away the time: And then the Moone, like to a siluer bow, Now bent in heauen, shal behold the night Of our solemnities   The. Go Philostrate, Stirre vp the Athenian youth to merriments, Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth, Turne melancholy forth to Funerals: The pale companion is not for our pompe,
Hippolita, I woo'd thee with my sword, And wonne thy loue, doing thee iniuries: But I will wed thee in another key, With pompe, with triumph, and with reuelling. Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, Lysander, and Demetrius.  Ege. Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke   The. Thanks good Egeus: what's the news with thee?  Ege. Full of vexation, come I, with complaint Against my childe, my daughter Hermia. Stand forth Demetrius. My Noble Lord, This man hath my consent to marrie her. Stand forth Lysander. And my gracious Duke, This man hath bewitch'd the bosome of my childe: Thou, thou Lysander, thou hast giuen her rimes, And interchang'd loue-tokens with my childe: Thou hast by Moone-light at her window sung, With faining voice, verses of faining loue, And stolne the impression of her fantasie, With bracelets of thy haire, rings, gawdes, conceits, Knackes, trifles, Nose-gaies, sweet meats (messengers Of strong preuailment in vnhardned youth) With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughters heart, Turn'd her obedience (which is due to me) To stubborne harshnesse. And my gracious Duke, Be it so she will not heere before your Grace, Consent to marrie with Demetrius, I beg the ancient priuiledge of Athens; As she is mine, I may dispose of her; Which shall be either to this Gentleman, Or to her death, according to our Law, Immediately prouided in that case   The. What say you Hermia? be aduis'd faire Maide, To you your Father should be as a God; One that compos'd your beauties; yea and one To whom you are but as a forme in waxe By him imprinted: and within his power, To leaue the figure, or disfigure it: Demetrius is a worthy Gentleman   Her. So is Lysander   The. In himselfe he is. But in this kinde, wanting your fathers voyce, The other must be held the worthier   Her. I would my father look'd but with my eyes   The. Rather your eies must with his iudgment looke   Her. I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold, Nor how it may concerne my modestie In such a presence heere to pleade my thoughts: But I beseech your Grace, that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case, If I refuse to wed Demetrius   The. Either to dye the death, or to abiure For euer the society of men. Therefore faire Hermia question your desires, Know of your youth, examine well your blood, Whether (if you yeeld not to your fathers choice) You can endure the liuerie of a Nunne, For aye to be in shady Cloister mew'd, To liue a barren sister all your life, Chanting faint hymnes to the cold fruitlesse Moone, Thrice blessed they that master so their blood, To vndergo such maiden pilgrimage, But earthlier happie is the Rose distil'd, Then that which withering on the virgin thorne, Growes, liues, and dies, in single blessednesse   Her. So will I grow, so liue, so die my Lord, Ere I will yeeld my virgin Patent vp Vnto his Lordship, whose vnwished yoake, My soule consents not to giue soueraignty   The. Take time to pause, and by the next new Moon The sealing day betwixt my loue and me, For euerlasting bond of fellowship: Vpon that day either prepare to dye, For disobedience to your fathers will, Or else to wed Demetrius as hee would, Or on Dianaes Altar to protest For aie, austerity, and single life   Dem. Relent sweet Hermia, and Lysander, yeelde Thy crazed title to my certaine right   Lys. You haue her fathers loue, Demetrius: Let me haue Hermiaes: do you marry him   Egeus. Scornfull Lysander, true, he hath my Loue; And what is mine, my loue shall render him. And she is mine, and all my right of her, I do estate vnto Demetrius   Lys. I am my Lord, as well deriu'd as he, As well possest: my loue is more then his: My fortunes euery way as fairely ranck'd (If not with vantage) as Demetrius: And (which is more then all these boasts can be) I am belou'd of beauteous Hermia. Why should not I then prosecute my right? Demetrius, Ile auouch it to his head, Made loue to Nedars daughter, Helena, And won her soule: and she (sweet Ladie) dotes, Deuoutly dotes, dotes in Idolatry, Vpon this spotted and inconstant man
   The. I must confesse, that I haue heard so much, And with Demetrius thought to haue spoke thereof: But being ouer-full of selfe-affaires, My minde did lose it. But Demetrius come, And come Egeus, you shall go with me, I haue some priuate schooling for you both. For you faire Hermia, looke you arme your selfe, To fit your fancies to your Fathers will; Or else the Law of Athens yeelds you vp (Which by no meanes we may extenuate) To death, or to a vow of single life. Come my Hippolita, what cheare my loue? Demetrius and Egeus go along: I must imploy you in some businesse Against our nuptiall, and conferre with you Of something, neerely that concernes your selues   Ege. With dutie and desire we follow you. Exeunt. Manet Lysander and Hermia.  Lys. How now my loue? Why is your cheek so pale? How chance the Roses there do fade so fast?  Her. Belike for want of raine, which I could well Beteeme them, from the tempest of mine eyes   Lys. For ought that euer I could reade, Could euer heare by tale or historie, The course of true loue neuer did run smooth, But either it was different in blood   Her. O crosse! too high to be enthral'd to loue   Lys. Or else misgraffed, in respect of yeares   Her. O spight! too old to be ingag'd to yong   Lys. Or else it stood vpon the choise of merit   Her. O hell! to choose loue by anothers eie   Lys. Or if there were a simpathie in choise, Warre, death, or sicknesse, did lay siege to it; Making it momentarie, as a sound: Swift as a shadow, short as any dreame, Briefe as the lightning in the collied night, That (in a spleene) vnfolds both heauen and earth; And ere a man hath power to say, behold, The iawes of darkness do deuoure it vp: So quicke bright things come to confusion   Her. If then true Louers haue beene euer crost, It stands as an edict in destinie: Then let vs teach our triall patience, Because it is a customarie crosse, As due to loue, as thoughts, and dreames, and sighes,
Wishes and teares; poore Fancies followers   Lys. A good perswasion; therefore heare me Hermia, I haue a Widdow Aunt, a dowager, Of great reuennew, and she hath no childe, From Athens is her house remou'd seuen leagues, And she respects me, as her onely sonne: There gentle Hermia, may I marrie thee, And to that place, the sharpe Athenian Law Cannot pursue vs. If thou lou'st me, then Steale forth thy Fathers house to morrow night: And in the wood, a league without the towne, (Where I did meete thee once with Helena. To do obseruance for a morne of May) There will I stay for thee   Her. My good Lysander, I sweare to thee, by Cupids strongest bow, By his best arrow with the golden head, By the simplicitie of Venus Doues, By that which knitteth soules, and prospers loue, And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queene, When the false Troyan vnder saile was seene, By all the vowes that euer men haue broke, (In number more then euer women spoke) In that same place thou hast appointed me, To morrow truly will I meete with thee   Lys. Keepe promise loue: looke here comes Helena. Enter Helena.  Her. God speede faire Helena, whither away?  Hel. Cal you me faire? that faire againe vnsay, Demetrius loues you faire: O happie faire! Your eyes are loadstarres, and your tongues sweete ayre More tuneable then Larke to shepheards eare, When wheate is greene, when hauthorne buds appeare, Sicknesse is catching: O were fauor so, Your words I catch, faire Hermia ere I go, My eare should catch your voice, my eye, your eye, My tongue should catch your tongues sweete melodie, Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, The rest Ile giue to be to you translated. O teach me how you looke, and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius hart   Her. I frowne vpon him, yet he loues me still   Hel. O that your frownes would teach my smiles such skil   Her. I giue him curses, yet he giues me loue   Hel. O that my prayers could such affection mooue   Her. The more I hate, the more he followes me   Hel. The more I loue, the more he hateth me
   Her. His folly Helena is none of mine   Hel. None but your beauty, wold that fault wer mine  Her. Take comfort: he no more shall see my face, Lysander and my selfe will flie this place. Before the time I did Lysander see, Seem'd Athens like a Paradise to mee. O then, what graces in my Loue do dwell, That he hath turn'd a heauen into hell   Lys. Helen, to you our mindes we will vnfold, To morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold Her siluer visage, in the watry glasse, Decking with liquid pearle, the bladed grasse (A time that Louers flights doth still conceale) Through Athens gates, haue we deuis'd to steale   Her. And in the wood, where often you and I, Vpon faint Primrose beds, were wont to lye, Emptying our bosomes, of their counsell sweld: There my Lysander, and my selfe shall meete, And thence from Athens turne away our eyes To seeke new friends and strange companions, Farwell sweet play-fellow, pray thou for vs, And good lucke grant thee thy Demetrius. Keepe word Lysander we must starue our sight, From louers foode, till morrow deepe midnight. Exit Hermia.  Lys. I will my Hermia. Helena adieu, As you on him, Demetrius dotes on you. Exit Lysander.  Hele. How happy some, ore othersome can be? Through Athens I am thought as faire as she. But what of that? Demetrius thinkes not so: He will not know, what all, but he doth know, And as hee erres, doting on Hermias eyes; So I, admiring of his qualities: Things base and vilde, holding no quantity, Loue can transpose to forme and dignity, Loue lookes not with the eyes, but with the minde, And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blinde. Nor hath loues minde of any iudgement taste: Wings and no eyes, figure, vnheedy haste. And therefore is Loue said to be a childe, Because in choise he is often beguil'd, As waggish boyes in game themselues forsweare; So the boy Loue is periur'd euery where. For ere Demetrius lookt on Hermias eyne, He hail'd downe oathes that he was onely mine. And when this Haile some heat from Hermia felt, So he dissolu'd, and showres of oathes did melt, I will goe tell him of faire Hermias flight: Then to the wood will he, to morrow night Pursue her; and for his intelligence, If I haue thankes, it is a deere expence:
But heerein meane I to enrich my paine, To haue his sight thither, and backe againe. Enter. Enter Quince the Carpenter, Snug the Ioyner, Bottome the Weauer, Flute the bellowes-mender, Snout the Tinker, and Starueling the Taylor.  Quin. Is all our company heere?  Bot. You were best to call them generally, man by man according to the scrip   Qui. Here is the scrowle of euery mans name, which is thought fit through all Athens, to play in our Enterlude before the Duke and the Dutches, on his wedding day at night   Bot. First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on: then read the names of the Actors: and so grow on to a point   Quin. Marry our play is the most lamentable comedy, and most cruell death of Pyramus and Thisbie   Bot. A very good peece of worke I assure you, and a merry. Now good Peter Quince, call forth your Actors by the scrowle. Masters spread your selues   Quince. Answere as I call you. Nick Bottome the Weauer   Bottome. Ready; name what part I am for, and proceed   Quince. You Nicke Bottome are set downe for Pyramus   Bot. What is Pyramus, a louer, or a tyrant?  Quin. A Louer that kills himselfe most gallantly for loue   Bot. That will aske some teares in the true performing of it: if I do it, let the audience looke to their eies: I will mooue stormes; I will condole in some measure. To the rest yet, my chiefe humour is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to teare a Cat in, to make all split the raging Rocks; and shiuering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates, and Phibbus carre shall shine from farre, and make and marre the foolish Fates. This was lofty. Now name the rest of the Players. This is Ercles vaine, a tyrants vaine: a louer is more condoling   Quin. Francis Flute the Bellowes-mender   Flu. Heere Peter Quince   Quin. You must take Thisbie on you   Flut. What is Thisbie, a wandring Knight?  Quin. It is the Lady that Pyramus must loue
   Flut. Nay faith, let not mee play a woman, I haue a beard comming   Qui. That's all one, you shall play it in a Maske, and you may speake as small as you will   Bot. And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbie too: Ile speake in a monstrous little voyce; Thisne, Thisne, ah Pyramus my louer deare, thy Thisbie deare, and Lady deare   Quin. No no, you must play Pyramus, and Flute, you Thisby   Bot. Well, proceed   Qu. Robin Starueling the Taylor   Star. Heere Peter Quince   Quince. Robin Starueling, you must play Thisbies mother? Tom Snowt, the Tinker   Snowt. Heere Peter Quince   Quin. you, Pyramus father; my self, Thisbies father; Snugge the Ioyner, you the Lyons part: and I hope there is a play fitted   Snug. Haue you the Lions part written? pray you if be, giue it me, for I am slow of studie   Quin. You may doe it extemporie, for it is nothing but roaring   Bot. Let mee play the Lyon too, I will roare that I will doe any mans heart good to heare me. I will roare, that I will make the Duke say, Let him roare againe, let him roare againe   Quin. If you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Dutchesse and the Ladies, that they would shrike, and that were enough to hang us all   All. That would hang vs euery mothers sonne   Bottome. I graunt you friends, if that you should fright the Ladies out of their Wittes, they would haue no more discretion but to hang vs: but I will aggrauate my voyce so, that I will roare you as gently as any sucking Doue; I will roare and 'twere any Nightingale   Quin. You can play no part but Piramus, for Piramus is a sweet-fac'd man, a proper man as one shall see in a summers day; a most louely Gentleman-like man, therfore you must needs play Piramus
   Bot. Well, I will vndertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?  Quin. Why, what you will   Bot. I will discharge it, in either your straw-colour beard, your orange tawnie beard, your purple in graine beard, or your French-crowne colour'd beard, your perfect yellow   Quin. Some of your French Crownes haue no haire at all, and then you will play bare-fac'd. But masters here are your parts, and I am to intreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by too morrow night: and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the Towne, by Moone-light, there we will rehearse: for if we meete in the Citie, we shalbe dog'd with company, and our deuises knowne. In the meane time, I wil draw a bil of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you faile me not   Bottom. We will meete, and there we may rehearse more obscenely and couragiously. Take paines, be perfect, adieu   Quin. At the Dukes oake we meete   Bot. Enough, hold or cut bow-strings. Exeunt. Actus Secundus. Enter a Fairie at one dore, and Robin goodfellow at another.  Rob. How now spirit, whether wander you?  Fai. Ouer hil, ouer dale, through bush, through briar, Ouer parke, ouer pale, through flood, through fire, I do wander euerie where, swifter then y Moons sphere; And I serue the Fairy Queene, to dew her orbs vpon the green. The Cowslips tall, her pensioners bee, In their gold coats, spots you see, Those be Rubies, Fairie fauors, In those freckles, liue their sauors, I must go seeke some dew drops heere, And hang a pearle in euery cowslips eare. Farewell thou Lob of spirits, Ile be gon, Our Queene and all her Elues come heere anon   Rob. The King doth keepe his Reuels here to night, Take heed the Queene come not within his sight, For Oberon is passing fell and wrath, Because that she, as her attendant, hath A louely boy stolne from an Indian King, She neuer had so sweet a changeling, And iealous Oberon would haue the childe Knight of his traine, to trace the Forrests wilde. But she (perforce) with-holds the loued boy, Crownes him with flowers, and makes him all her ioy. And now they neuer meete in groue, or greene, By fountaine cleere, or spangled star-light sheene,
But they do square, that all their Elues for feare Creepe into Acorne cups and hide them there   Fai. Either I mistake your shape and making quite, Or else you are that shrew'd and knauish spirit Cal'd Robin Good-fellow. Are you not hee, That frights the maidens of the Villagree, Skim milke, and sometimes labour in the querne, And bootlesse make the breathlesse huswife cherne, And sometime make the drinke to beare no barme, Misleade night-wanderers, laughing at their harme, Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Pucke, You do their worke, and they shall haue good lucke. Are not you he?  Rob. Thou speak'st aright; I am that merrie wanderer of the night: I iest to Oberon, and make him smile, When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, Neighing in likenesse of a silly foale, And sometime lurke I in a Gossips bole, In very likenesse of a roasted crab: And when she drinkes, against her lips I bob, And on her withered dewlop poure the Ale. The wisest Aunt telling the saddest tale, Sometime for three-foot stoole, mistaketh me, Then slip I from her bum, downe topples she, And tailour cries, and fals into a coffe. And then the whole quire hold their hips, and loffe, And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and sweare, A merrier houre was neuer wasted there. But roome Fairy, heere comes Oberon   Fair. And heere my Mistris: Would that he were gone. Enter the King of Fairies at one doore with his traine, and the Queene at another with hers.  Ob. Ill met by Moone-light. Proud Tytania   Qu. What, iealous Oberon? Fairy skip hence. I haue forsworne his bed and companie   Ob. Tarrie rash Wanton; am not I thy Lord?  Qu. Then I must be thy Lady: but I know When thou wast stolne away from Fairy Land, And in the shape of Corin, sate all day, Playing on pipes of Corne, and versing loue To amorous Phillida. Why art thou heere Come from the farthest steepe of India? But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon Your buskin'd Mistresse, and your Warrior loue, To Theseus must be Wedded; and you come, To giue their bed ioy and prosperitie   Ob. How canst thou thus for shame Tytania. Glance at my credite, with Hippolita? Knowing I know thy loue to Theseus?
Didst thou not leade him through the glimmering night From Peregenia, whom he rauished? And make him with faire Eagles breake his faith With Ariadne, and Antiopa?  Que. These are the forgeries of iealousie, And neuer since the middle Summers spring Met we on hil, in dale, forrest, or mead, By paued fountaine, or by rushie brooke, Or in the beached margent of the sea, To dance our ringlets to the whistling Winde, But with thy braules thou hast disturb'd our sport. Therefore the Windes, piping to vs in vaine, As in reuenge, haue suck'd vp from the sea Contagious fogges: Which falling in the Land, Hath euerie petty Riuer made so proud, That they haue ouer-borne their Continents. The Oxe hath therefore stretch'd his yoake in vaine, The Ploughman lost his sweat, and the greene Corne Hath rotted, ere his youth attain'd a beard: The fold stands empty in the drowned field, And Crowes are fatted with the murrion flocke, The nine mens Morris is fild vp with mud, And the queint Mazes in the wanton greene, For lacke of tread are vndistinguishable. The humane mortals want their winter heere, No night is now with hymne or caroll blest; Therefore the Moone (the gouernesse of floods) Pale in her anger, washes all the aire; That Rheumaticke diseases doe abound. And through this distemperature, we see The seasons alter; hoared headed Frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson Rose, And on old Hyems chinne and Icie crowne, An odorous Chaplet of sweet Sommer buds Is as in mockry set. The Spring, the Sommer, The childing Autumne, angry Winter change Their wonted Liueries, and the mazed world, By their increase, now knowes not which is which; And this same progeny of euills, Comes from our debate, from our dissention, We are their parents and originall   Ober. Do you amend it then, it lies in you, Why should Titania crosse her Oberon? I do but beg a little changeling boy, To be my Henchman   Qu. Set your heart at rest, The Fairy land buyes not the childe of me, His mother was a Votresse of my Order, And in the spiced Indian aire, by night Full often hath she gossipt by my side, And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands, Marking th' embarked traders on the flood, When we haue laught to see the sailes conceiue, And grow big bellied with the wanton winde: Which she with pretty and with swimming gate, Following (her wombe then rich with my yong squire) Would imitate, and saile vpon the Land,
To fetch me trifles, and returne againe, As from a voyage, rich with merchandize. But she being mortall, of that boy did die, And for her sake I doe reare vp her boy, And for her sake I will not part with him   Ob. How long within this wood intend you stay?  Qu. Perchance till after Theseus wedding day. If you will patiently dance in our Round, And see our Moone-light reuels, goe with vs; If not, shun me and I will spare your haunts   Ob. Giue me that boy, and I will goe with thee   Qu. Not for thy Fairy Kingdome. Fairies away: We shall chide downe right, if I longer stay. Exeunt   Ob. Wel, go thy way: thou shalt not from this groue, Till I torment thee for this iniury. My gentle Pucke come hither; thou remembrest Since once I sat vpon a promontory, And heard a Meare-maide on a Dolphins backe, Vttering such dulcet and harmonious breath, That the rude sea grew ciuill at her song, And certaine starres shot madly from their Spheares, To heare the Sea-maids musicke   Puc. I remember   Ob. That very time I say (but thou couldst not) Flying betweene the cold Moone and the earth, Cupid all arm'd; a certaine aime he tooke At a faire Vestall, throned by the West, And loos'd his loue-shaft smartly from his bow, As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts, But I might see young Cupids fiery shaft Quencht in the chaste beames of the watry Moone; And the imperiall Votresse passed on, In maiden meditation, fancy free. Yet markt I where the bolt of Cupid fell. It fell vpon a little westerne flower; Before, milke-white: now purple with loues wound, And maidens call it, Loue in idlenesse. Fetch me that flower; the hearb I shew'd thee once, The iuyce of it, on sleeping eye-lids laid, Will make or man or woman madly dote Vpon the next liue creature that it sees. Fetch me this hearbe, and be thou heere againe, Ere the Leuiathan can swim a league   Pucke. Ile put a girdle about the earth, in forty minutes   Ober. Hauing once this iuyce, Ile watch Titania, when she is asleepe, And drop the liquor of it in her eyes: The next thing when she waking lookes vpon, (Be it on Lyon, Beare, or Wolfe, or Bull,
On medling Monkey, or on busie Ape) Shee shall pursue it, with the soule of loue. And ere I take this charme off from her sight, (As I can take it with another hearbe) Ile make her render vp her Page to me. But who comes heere? I am inuisible, And I will ouer-heare their conference. Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.  Deme. I loue thee not, therefore pursue me not, Where is Lysander, and faire Hermia? The one Ile stay, the other stayeth me. Thou toldst me they were stolne into this wood; And heere am I, and wood within this wood, Because I cannot meet my Hermia. Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more   Hel. You draw me, you hard-hearted Adamant, But yet you draw not Iron, for my heart Is true as steele. Leaue you your power to draw, And I shall haue no power to follow you   Deme. Do I entice you? do I speake you faire? Or rather doe I not in plainest truth, Tell you I doe not, nor I cannot loue you?  Hel. And euen for that doe I loue thee the more; I am your spaniell, and Demetrius, The more you beat me, I will fawne on you. Vse me but as your spaniell; spurne me, strike me, Neglect me, lose me; onely giue me leaue (Vnworthy as I am) to follow you. What worser place can I beg in your loue, (And yet a place of high respect with me) Then to be vsed as you doe your dogge   Dem. Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit, For I am sicke when I do looke on thee   Hel. And I am sicke when I looke not on you   Dem. You doe impeach your modesty too much, To leaue the Citty, and commit your selfe Into the hands of one that loues you not, To trust the opportunity of night. And the ill counsell of a desert place, With the rich worth of your virginity   Hel. Your vertue is my priuiledge: for that It is not night when I doe see your face. Therefore I thinke I am not in the night, Nor doth this wood lacke worlds of company, For you in my respect are all the world. Then how can it be said I am alone, When all the world is heere to looke on me?  Dem. Ile run from thee, and hide me in the brakes, And leaue thee to the mercy of wilde beasts   Hel. The wildest hath not such a heart as you; Runne when you will, the story shall be chang'd:
Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase; The Doue pursues the Griffin, the milde Hinde Makes speed to catch the Tyger. Bootlesse speede, When cowardise pursues, and valour flies   Demet. I will not stay thy questions, let me go; Or if thou follow me, doe not beleeue, But I shall doe thee mischiefe in the wood   Hel. I, in the Temple, in the Towne, and Field You doe me mischiefe. Fye Demetrius, Your wrongs doe set a scandall on my sexe: We cannot fight for loue, as men may doe; We should be woo'd, and were not made to wooe. I follow thee, and make a heauen of hell, To die vpon the hand I loue so well. Enter.  Ob. Fare thee well Nymph, ere he do leaue this groue, Thou shalt flie him, and he shall seeke thy loue. Hast thou the flower there? Welcome wanderer. Enter Pucke.  Puck. I there it is   Ob. I pray thee giue it me. I know a banke where the wilde time blowes, Where Oxslips and the nodding Violet growes, Quite ouer-cannoped with luscious woodbine, With sweet muske roses, and with Eglantine; There sleepes Tytania, sometime of the night, Lul'd in these flowers, with dances and delight: And there the snake throwes her enammel'd skinne, Weed wide enough to rap a Fairy in. And with the iuyce of this Ile streake her eyes, And make her full of hatefull fantasies. Take thou some of it, and seek through this groue; A sweet Athenian Lady is in loue With a disdainefull youth: annoint his eyes, But doe it when the next thing he espies, May be the Lady. Thou shalt know the man, By the Athenian garments he hath on. Effect it with some care, that he may proue More fond on her, then she vpon her loue; And looke thou meet me ere the first Cocke crow   Pu. Feare not my Lord, your seruant shall do so. Enter. Enter Queene of Fairies, with her traine.  Queen. Come, now a Roundell, and a Fairy song; Then for the third part of a minute hence, Some to kill Cankers in the muske rose buds, Some warre with Reremise, for their leathern wings. To make my small Elues coates, and some keepe backe The clamorous Owle that nightly hoots and wonders At our queint spirits: Sing me now asleepe, Then to your offices, and let me rest
   Fairies Sing. You spotted Snakes with double tongue, Thorny Hedgehogges be not seene, Newts and blinde wormes do no wrong, Come not neere our Fairy Queene. Philomele with melodie, Sing in your sweet Lullaby. Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby, Neuer harme, nor spell, nor charme, Come our louely Lady nye, So good night with Lullaby   2.Fairy. Weauing Spiders come not heere, Hence you long leg'd Spinners, hence: Beetles blacke approach not neere; Worme nor Snayle doe no offence. Philomele with melody, &c   1.Fairy. Hence away, now all is well; One aloofe, stand Centinell. Shee sleepes. Enter Oberon.  Ober. What thou seest when thou dost wake, Do it for thy true Loue take: Loue and languish for his sake. Be it Ounce, or Catte, or Beare, Pard, or Boare with bristled haire, In thy eye that shall appeare, When thou wak'st, it is thy deare, Wake when some vile thing is neere. Enter Lisander and Hermia.  Lis. Faire loue, you faint with wandring in y woods, And to speake troth I haue forgot our way: Wee'll rest vs Hermia, If you thinke it good, And tarry for the comfort of the day   Her. Be it so Lysander; finde you out a bed, For I vpon this banke will rest my head   Lys. One turfe shall serue as pillow for vs both, One heart, one bed, two bosomes, and one troth   Her. Nay good Lysander, for my sake my deere Lie further off yet, doe not lie so neere   Lys. O take the sence sweet, of my innocence, Loue takes the meaning, in loues conference, I meane that my heart vnto yours is knit, So that but one heart can you make of it. Two bosomes interchanged with an oath, So then two bosomes, and a single troth. Then by your side, no bed-roome me deny, For lying so, Hermia, I doe not lye   Her. Lysander riddles very prettily;
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride, If Hermia meant to say, Lysander lied. But gentle friend, for loue and courtesie Lie further off, in humane modesty, Such separation, as may well be said, Becomes a vertuous batchelour, and a maide, So farre be distant, and good night sweet friend; Thy loue nere alter, till thy sweet life end   Lys. Amen, amen, to that faire prayer, say I, And then end life, when I end loyalty: Heere is my bed, sleepe giue thee all his rest   Her. With halfe that wish, the wishers eyes be prest. Enter Pucke. They sleepe.  Puck. Through the Forest haue I gone, But Athenian finde I none, One whose eyes I might approue This flowers force in stirring loue. Nigh and silence: who is heere? Weedes of Athens he doth weare: This is he (my master said) Despised the Athenian maide: And heere the maiden sleeping sound, On the danke and durty ground. Pretty soule, she durst not lye Neere this lacke-loue, this kill-curtesie. Churle, vpon thy eyes I throw All the power this charme doth owe: When thou wak'st, let loue forbid Sleepe his seate on thy eye-lid. So awake when I am gone: For I must now to Oberon. Enter. Enter Demetrius and Helena running.  Hel. Stay, though thou kill me, sweete Demetrius   De. I charge thee hence, and do not haunt me thus   Hel. O wilt thou darkling leaue me? do not so   De. Stay on thy perill, I alone will goe. Exit Demetrius.  Hel. O I am out of breath, in this fond chace, The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace, Happy is Hermia, wheresoere she lies; For she hath blessed and attractiue eyes. How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt teares. If so, my eyes are oftner washt then hers. No, no, I am as vgly as a Beare; For beasts that meete me, runne away for feare, Therefore no maruaile, though Demetrius Doe as a monster, flie my presence thus. What wicked and dissembling glasse of mine,
Made me compare with Hermias sphery eyne? But who is here? Lysander on the ground; Deade or asleepe? I see no bloud, no wound, Lysander, if you liue, good sir awake   Lys. And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake. Transparent Helena, nature her shewes art, That through thy bosome makes me see thy heart. Where is Demetrius? oh how fit a word Is that vile name, to perish on my sword!  Hel. Do not say so Lysander, say not so: What though he loue your Hermia? Lord, what though? Yet Hermia still loues you; then be content   Lys. Content with Hermia? no, I do repent The tedious minutes I with her haue spent. Not Hermia, but Helena now I loue; Who will not change a Rauen for a Doue? The will of man is by his reason sway'd: And reason saies you are the worthier Maide. Things growing are not ripe vntill their season; So I being yong, till now ripe not to reason, And touching now the point of humane skill, Reason becomes the Marshall to my will. And leades me to your eyes, where I orelooke Loues stories, written in Loues richest booke   Hel. Wherefore was I to this keene mockery borne? When at your hands did I deserue this scorne? Ist not enough, ist not enough, yong man, That I did neuer, no nor neuer can, Deserue a sweete looke from Demetrius eye, But you must flout my insufficiency? Good troth you do me wrong (good-sooth you do) In such disdainfull manner, me to wooe. But fare you well; perforce I must confesse, I thought you Lord of more true gentlenesse. Oh, that a Lady of one man refus'd, Should of another therefore be abus'd. Enter   Lys. She sees not Hermia: Hermia sleepe thou there, And neuer maist thou come Lysander neere; For as a surfeit of the sweetest things The deepest loathing to the stomacke brings: Or as the heresies that men do leaue, Are hated most of those that did deceiue: So thou, my surfeit, and my heresie, Of all be hated; but the most of me; And all my powers addresse your loue and might, To honour Helen, and to be her Knight. Enter.  Her. Helpe me Lysander, helpe me; do thy best To plucke this crawling serpent from my brest. Aye me, for pitty; what a dreame was here? Lysander looke, how I do quake with feare: Me-thought a serpent eate my heart away, And yet sat smiling at his cruell prey.
Lysander, What remoou'd? Lysander, Lord, What, out of hearing, gone? No sound, no word? Alacke where are you? speake and if you heare: Speake of all loues; I sound almost with feare. No, then I well perceiue you are not nye, Either death or you Ile finde immediately. Enter.
Actus Tertius. Enter the Clownes.  Bot. Are we all met?  Quin. Pat, pat, and here's a maruailous conuenient place for our rehearsall. This greene plot shall be our stage, this hauthorne brake our tyring house, and we will do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke   Bot. Peter Quince?  Peter. What saist thou, bully Bottome?  Bot. There are things in this Comedy of Piramus and Thisby, that will neuer please. First, Piramus must draw a sword to kill himselfe; which the Ladies cannot abide. How answere you that?  Snout. Berlaken, a parlous feare   Star. I beleeue we must leaue the killing out, when all is done   Bot. Not a whit, I haue a deuice to make all well. Write me a Prologue, and let the Prologue seeme to say, we will do no harme with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kill'd indeede: and for the more better assurance, tell them, that I Piramus am not Piramus, but Bottome the Weauer; this will put them out of feare   Quin. Well, we will haue such a Prologue, and it shall be written in eight and sixe   Bot. No, make it two more, let it be written in eight and eight   Snout. Will not the Ladies be afear'd of the Lyon?  Star. I feare it, I promise you   Bot. Masters, you ought to consider with your selues, to bring in (God shield vs) a Lyon among Ladies, is a most dreadfull thing. For there is not a more fearefull wilde foule then your Lyon liuing: and wee ought to looke to it   Snout. Therefore another Prologue must tell he is not a Lyon   Bot. Nay, you must name his name, and halfe his face must be seene through the Lyons necke, and he himselfe must speake through, saying thus, or to the same defect; Ladies, or faire Ladies, I would wish you, or I would
request you, or I would entreat you, not to feare, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you thinke I come hither as a Lyon, it were pitty of my life. No, I am no such thing, I am a man as other men are; and there indeed let him name his name, and tell him plainly hee is Snug the ioyner   Quin. Well, it shall be so; but there is two hard things, that is, to bring the Moone-light into a chamber: for you know Piramus and Thisby meete by Moonelight   Sn. Doth the Moone shine that night wee play our play?  Bot. A Calender, a Calender, looke in the Almanack, finde out Moone-shine, finde out Moone-shine. Enter Pucke.  Quin. Yes, it doth shine that night   Bot. Why then may you leaue a casement of the great chamber window (where we play) open, and the Moone may shine in at the casement   Quin. I, or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorne, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present the person of Moone-shine. Then there is another thing, we must haue a wall in the great Chamber; for Piramus and Thisby (saies the story) did talke through the chinke of a wall   Sn. You can neuer bring in a wall. What say you Bottome?  Bot. Some man or other must present wall, and let him haue some Plaster, or some Lome, or some rough cast about him, to signifie wall; or let him hold his fingers thus; and through that cranny shall Piramus and Thisby whisper   Quin. If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit downe euery mothers sonne, and rehearse your parts. Piramus, you begin; when you haue spoken your speech, enter into that Brake, and so euery one according to his cue. Enter Robin.  Rob. What hempen home-spuns haue we swaggering here, So neere the Cradle of the Faierie Queene? What, a Play toward? Ile be an auditor, An Actor too perhaps, if I see cause   Quin. Speake Piramus: Thisby stand forth   Pir. Thisby, the flowers of odious sauors sweete   Quin. Odours, odours   Pir. Odours sauors sweete, So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby deare.
But harke, a voyce: stay thou but here a while, And by and by I will to thee appeare. Exit. Pir.  Puck. A stranger Piramus, then ere plaid here   This. Must I speake now?  Pet. I marry must you. For you must vnderstand he goes but to see a noyse that he heard, and is to come againe   Thys. Most radiant Piramus, most Lilly white of hue, Of colour like the red rose on triumphant bryer, Most brisky Iuuenall, and eke most louely Iew, As true as truest horse, that yet would neuer tyre, Ile meete thee Piramus, at Ninnies toombe   Pet. Ninus toombe man: why, you must not speake that yet; that you answere to Piramus: you speake all your part at once, cues and all. Piramus enter, your cue is past; it is neuer tyre   Thys. O, as true as truest horse, that yet would neuer tyre:  Pir. If I were faire, Thisby I were onely thine   Pet. O monstrous. O strange. We are hanted; pray masters, flye masters, helpe. The Clownes all Exit.  Puk. Ile follow you, Ile leade you about a Round, Through bogge, through bush, through brake, through bryer, Sometime a horse Ile be, sometime a hound: A hogge, a headlesse beare, sometime a fire, And neigh, and barke, and grunt, and rore, and burne, Like horse, hound, hog, beare, fire, at euery turne. Enter. Enter Piramus with the Asse head.  Bot. Why do they run away? This is a knauery of them to make me afeard. Enter Snowt   Sn. O Bottom, thou art chang'd; What doe I see on thee?  Bot. What do you see? You see an Asse-head of your owne, do you? Enter Peter Quince.  Pet. Blesse thee Bottome, blesse thee; thou art translated. Enter.  Bot. I see their knauery; this is to make an asse of me, to fright me if they could; but I will not stirre from this place, do what they can. I will walke vp and downe here, and I will sing that they shall heare I am not afraid. The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew,
With Orenge-tawny bill. The Throstle, with his note so true, The Wren and little quill   Tyta. What Angell wakes me from my flowry bed?  Bot. The Finch, the Sparrow, and the Larke, The plainsong Cuckow gray; Whose note full many a man doth marke, And dares not answere, nay. For indeede, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird? Who would giue a bird the lye, though he cry Cuckow, neuer so?  Tyta. I pray thee gentle mortall, sing againe, Mine eare is much enamored of thy note; On the first view to say, to sweare I loue thee. So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape. And thy faire vertues force (perforce) doth moue me   Bot. Me-thinkes mistresse, you should haue little reason for that: and yet to say the truth, reason and loue keepe little company together, nowadayes. The more the pittie, that some honest neighbours will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleeke vpon occasion   Tyta. Thou art as wise, as thou art beautifull   Bot. Not so neither: but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I haue enough to serue mine owne turne   Tyta. Out of this wood, do not desire to goe, Thou shalt remaine here, whether thou wilt or no. I am a spirit of no common rate: The Summer still doth tend vpon my state, And I doe loue thee; therefore goe with me, Ile giue thee Fairies to attend on thee; And they shall fetch thee Iewels from the deepe, And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleepe: And I will purge thy mortall grossenesse so, That thou shalt like an airie spirit go. Enter Pease-blossome, Cobweb, Moth, Mustardseede, and foure Fairies.  Fai. Ready; and I, and I, and I, Where shall we go?  Tita. Be kinde and curteous to this Gentleman, Hop in his walkes, and gambole in his eies, Feede him with Apricocks, and Dewberries, With purple Grapes, greene Figs, and Mulberries, The honie-bags steale from the humble Bees, And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighes, And light them at the fierie-Glow-wormes eyes, To haue my loue to bed, and to arise: And plucke the wings from painted Butterflies, To fan the Moone-beames from his sleeping eies. Nod to him Elues, and doe him curtesies   1.Fai. Haile mortall, haile   2.Fai. Haile
   3.Fai. Haile   Bot. I cry your worships mercy hartily; I beseech your worships name   Cob. Cobweb   Bot. I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you. Your name honest Gentleman?  Pease. Pease Blossome   Bot. I pray you commend me to mistresse Squash, your mother, and to master Peascod your father. Good master Pease-blossome, I shal desire of you more acquaintance to. Your name I beseech you sir?  Mus. Mustard-seede   Peas. Pease-blossome   Bot. Good master Mustard seede, I know your patience well: that same cowardly gyant-like Oxe beefe hath deuoured many a gentleman of your house. I promise you, your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now. I desire you more acquaintance, good Master Mustard-seede   Tita. Come waite vpon him, lead him to my bower. The Moone me-thinks, lookes with a watrie eie, And when she weepes, weepe euerie little flower, Lamenting some enforced chastitie. Tye vp my louers tongue, bring him silently. Enter. Enter King of Pharies, solus.  Ob. I wonder if Titania be awak't; Then what it was that next came in her eye, Which she must dote on, in extremitie. Enter Pucke. Here comes my messenger: how now mad spirit, What night-rule now about this haunted groue?  Puck. My Mistris with a monster is in loue, Neere to her close and consecrated bower, While she was in her dull and sleeping hower, A crew of patches, rude Mechanicals, That worke for bread vpon Athenian stals, Were met together to rehearse a Play, Intended for great Theseus nuptiall day: The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort, Who Piramus presented, in their sport, Forsooke his Scene, and entred in a brake, When I did him at this aduantage take, An Asses nole I fixed on his head. Anon his Thisbie must be answered, And forth my Mimmick comes: when they him spie,
As Wilde-geese, that the creeping Fowler eye, Or russed-pated choughes, many in sort (Rising and cawing at the guns report) Seuer themselues, and madly sweepe the skye: So at his sight, away his fellowes flye, And at our stampe, here ore and ore one fals; He murther cries, and helpe from Athens cals. Their sense thus weake, lost with their feares thus strong, Made senslesse things begin to do them wrong. For briars and thornes at their apparell snatch, Some sleeues, some hats, from yeelders all things catch, I led them on in this distracted feare, And left sweete Piramus translated there: When in that moment (so it came to passe) Tytania waked, and straightway lou'd an Asse   Ob. This fals out better then I could deuise: But hast thou yet lacht the Athenians eyes, With the loue iuyce, as I bid thee doe?  Rob. I tooke him sleeping (that is finisht to) And the Athenian woman by his side, That when he wak't, of force she must be eyde. Enter Demetrius and Hermia.  Ob. Stand close, this is the same Athenian   Rob. This is the woman, but not this the man   Dem. O why rebuke you him that loues you so? Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe   Her. Now I but chide, but I should vse thee worse. For thou (I feare) hast giuen me cause to curse, If thou hast slaine Lysander in his sleepe, Being oreshooes in bloud, plunge in the deepe, and kill me too: The Sunne was not so true vnto the day, As he to me. Would he haue stollen away, From sleeping Hermia? Ile beleeue as soone This whole earth may be bord, and that the Moone May through the Center creepe, and so displease Her brothers noonetide, with th'Antipodes. It cannot be but thou hast murdred him, So should a murtherer looke, so dead, so grim   Dem. So should the murderer looke, and so should I, Pierst through the heart with your stearne cruelty: Yet you the murderer lookes as bright as cleare, As yonder Venus in her glimmering spheare   Her. What's this to my Lysander? where is he? Ah good Demetrius, wilt thou giue him me?  Dem. I'de rather giue his carkasse to my hounds   Her. Out dog, out cur, thou driu'st me past the bounds Of maidens patience. Hast thou slaine him then? Henceforth be neuer numbred among men. Oh, once tell true, euen for my sake, Durst thou a lookt vpon him, being awake?
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O braue tutch: Could not a worme, an Adder do so much? An Adder did it: for with doubler tongue Then thine (thou serpent) neuer Adder stung   Dem. You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood, I am not guiltie of Lysanders blood: Nor is he dead for ought that I can tell   Her. I pray thee tell me then that he is well   Dem. And if I could, what should I get therefore?  Her. A priuiledge, neuer to see me more; And from thy hated presence part I: see me no more Whether he be dead or no. Enter.  Dem. There is no following her in this fierce vaine, Here therefore for a while I will remaine. So sorrowes heauinesse doth heauier grow: For debt that bankrout slip doth sorrow owe, Which now in some slight measure it will pay, If for his tender here I make some stay. Lie downe.  Ob. What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite And laid the loue iuyce on some true loues sight: Of thy misprision, must perforce ensue Some true loue turn'd, and not a false turn'd true   Rob. Then fate ore-rules, that one man holding troth, A million faile, confounding oath on oath   Ob. About the wood, goe swifter then the winde, And Helena of Athens looke thou finde. All fancy sicke she is, and pale of cheere, With sighes of loue, that costs the fresh bloud deare. By some illusion see thou bring her heere, Ile charme his eyes against she doth appeare   Robin. I go, I go, looke how I goe, Swifter then arrow from the Tartars bowe. Enter.  Ob. Flower of this purple die, Hit with Cupids archery, Sinke in apple of his eye, When his loue he doth espie, Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky. When thou wak'st if she be by, Beg of her for remedy. Enter Pucke.  Puck. Captaine of our Fairy band, Helena is heere at hand, And the youth, mistooke by me, Pleading for a Louers fee.
Shall we their fond Pageant see? Lord, what fooles these mortals be!  Ob. Stand aside: the noyse they make, Will cause Demetrius to awake   Puck. Then will two at once wooe one, That must needs be sport alone: And those things doe best please me, That befall preposterously. Enter Lysander and Helena.  Lys. Why should you think y I should wooe in scorn? Scorne and derision neuer comes in teares: Looke when I vow I weepe; and vowes so borne, In their natiuity all truth appeares. How can these things in me, seeme scorne to you? Bearing the badge of faith to proue them true   Hel. You doe aduance your cunning more & more, When truth kils truth, O diuelish holy fray! These vowes are Hermias. Will you giue her ore? Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh. Your vowes to her, and me, (put in two scales) Will euen weigh, and both as light as tales   Lys. I had no iudgement, when to her I swore   Hel. Nor none in my minde, now you giue her ore   Lys. Demetrius loues her, and he loues not you. Awa.  Dem. O Helen, goddesse, nimph, perfect, diuine, To what, my loue, shall I compare thine eyne! Christall is muddy, O how ripe in show, Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow! That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow, Fan'd with the Easterne winde, turnes to a crow, When thou holdst vp thy hand. O let me kisse This Princesse of pure white, this seale of blisse   Hell. O spight! O hell! I see you are all bent To set against me, for your merriment: If you were ciuill, and knew curtesie, You would not doe me thus much iniury. Can you not hate me, as I know you doe, But you must ioyne in soules to mocke me to? If you are men, as men you are in show, You would not vse a gentle Lady so; To vow, and sweare, and superpraise my parts, When I am sure you hate me with your hearts. You both are Riuals, and loue Hermia; And now both Riuals to mocke Helena. A trim exploit, a manly enterprize, To coniure teares vp in a poore maids eyes, With your derision; none of noble sort, Would so offend a Virgin, and extort A poore soules patience, all to make you sport,
  Lysa. You are vnkind Demetrius; be not so, For you loue Hermia; this you know I know; And here with all good will, with all my heart, In Hermias loue I yeeld you vp my part; And yours of Helena, To me bequeath, Whom I do loue, and will do to my death   Hel. Neuer did mockers wast more idle breth   Dem. Lysander, keep thy Hermia, I will none: If ere I lou'd her, all that loue is gone. My heart to her, but as guest-wise soiourn'd, And now to Helen it is home return'd, There to remaine   Lys. It is not so   De. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know, Lest to thy perill thou abide it deare. Looke where thy Loue comes, yonder is thy deare. Enter Hermia.  Her. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes, The eare more quicke of apprehension makes, Wherein it doth impaire the seeing sense, It paies the hearing double recompence. Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander found, Mine eare (I thanke it) brought me to that sound. But why vnkindly didst thou leaue me so?  Lysan. Why should hee stay whom Loue doth presse to go?  Her. What loue could presse Lysander from my side?  Lys. Lysanders loue (that would not let him bide) Faire Helena; who more engilds the night, Then all yon fierie oes, and eies of light. Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know, The hate I bare thee, made me leaue thee so?  Her. You speake not as you thinke; it cannot be   Hel. Loe, she is one of this confederacy, Now I perceiue they haue conioyn'd all three, To fashion this false sport in spight of me. Iniurous Hermia, most vngratefull maid, Haue you conspir'd, haue you with these contriu'd To baite me, with this foule derision? Is all the counsell that we two haue shar'd, The sisters vowes, the houres that we haue spent, When wee haue chid the hasty footed time, For parting vs; O, is all forgot? All schooledaies friendship, child-hood innocence? We Hermia, like two Artificiall gods, Haue with our needles, created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key: As if our hands, our sides, voices, and mindes Had beene incorporate. So we grew together, Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, But yet a vnion in partition, Two louely berries molded on one stem, So with two seeming bodies, but one heart,
Two of the first life coats in Heraldry, Due but to one and crowned with one crest. And will you rent our ancient loue asunder, To ioyne with men in scorning your poore friend? It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly. Our sexe as well as I, may chide you for it, Though I alone doe feele the iniurie   Her. I am amazed at your passionate words, I scorne you not; It seemes that you scorne me   Hel. Haue you not set Lysander, as in scorne To follow me, and praise my eies and face? And made your other loue, Demetrius (Who euen but now did spurne me with his foote) To call me goddesse, nimph, diuine, and rare, Precious, celestiall? Wherefore speakes he this To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander Denie your loue (so rich within his soule) And tender me (forsooth) affection, But by your setting on, by your consent? What though I be not so in grace as you, So hung vpon with loue, so fortunate? (But miserable most, to loue vnlou'd) This you should pittie, rather then despise   Her. I vnderstand not what you meane by this   Hel. I, doe, perseuer, counterfeit sad lookes, Make mouthes vpon me when I turne my backe, Winke each at other, hold the sweete iest vp: This sport well carried, shall be chronicled. If you haue any pittie, grace, or manners, You would not make me such an argument: But fare ye well, 'tis partly mine owne fault, Which death or absence soone shall remedie   Lys. Stay gentle Helena, heare my excuse, My loue, my life, my soule, faire Helena   Hel. O excellent!  Her. Sweete, do not scorne her so   Dem. If she cannot entreate, I can compell   Lys. Thou canst compell, no more then she entreate. Thy threats haue no more strength then her weak praise. Helen, I loue thee, by my life I doe; I sweare by that which I will lose for thee, To proue him false, that saies I loue thee not   Dem. I say, I loue thee more then he can do   Lys. If thou say so, withdraw and proue it too   Dem. Quick, come   Her. Lysander, whereto tends all this?  Lys. Away, you Ethiope
   Dem. No, no, Sir, seeme to breake loose; Take on as you would follow, But yet come not: you are a tame man, go   Lys. Hang off thou cat, thou bur; vile thing let loose, Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent   Her. Why are you growne so rude? What change is this sweete Loue?  Lys. Thy loue? out tawny Tartar, out; Out loathed medicine; O hated poison hence   Her. Do you not iest?  Hel. Yes sooth, and so do you   Lys. Demetrius: I will keepe my word with thee   Dem. I would I had your bond: for I perceiue A weake bond holds you; Ile not trust your word   Lys. What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead? Although I hate her, Ile not harme her so   Her. What, can you do me greater harme then hate? Hate me, wherefore? O me, what newes my Loue? Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander? I am as faire now, as I was ere while. Since night you lou'd me: yet since night you left me. Why then you left me (O the gods forbid) In earnest, shall I say?  Lys. I, by my life; And neuer did desire to see thee more. Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt; Be certaine, nothing truer: 'tis no iest, That I do hate thee, and loue Helena   Her. O me, you iugler, you canker blossome, You theefe of loue; What, haue you come by night, And stolne my loues heart from him?  Hel. Fine yfaith: Haue you no modesty, no maiden shame, No touch of bashfulnesse? What, will you teare Impatient answers from my gentle tongue? Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you   Her. Puppet? why so? I, that way goes the game. Now I perceiue that she hath made compare Betweene our statures, she hath vrg'd her height, And with her personage, her tall personage, Her height (forsooth) she hath preuail'd with him. And are you growne so high in his esteeme, Because I am so dwarfish, and so low? How low am I, thou painted May-pole? Speake, How low am I? I am not yet so low, But that my nailes can reach vnto thine eyes   Hel. I pray you though you mocke me, gentlemen, Let her not hurt me; I was neuer curst:
I haue no gift at all in shrewishnesse; I am a right maide for my cowardize; Let her not strike me: you perhaps may thinke, Because she is something lower then my selfe, That I can match her   Her. Lower? harke againe   Hel. Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me, I euermore did loue you Hermia, Did euer keepe your counsels, neuer wronged you, Saue that in loue vnto Demetrius, I told him of your stealth vnto this wood. He followed you, for loue I followed him, But he hath chid me hence, and threatned me To strike me, spurne me, nay to kill me too; And now, so you will let me quiet go, To Athens will I beare my folly backe, And follow you no further. Let me go. You see how simple, and how fond I am   Her. Why get you gone: who ist that hinders you?  Hel. A foolish heart, that I leaue here behinde   Her. What, with Lysander?  Her. With Demetrius   Lys. Be not afraid, she shall not harme thee Helena   Dem. No sir, she shall not, though you take her part   Hel. O when she's angry, she is keene and shrewd, She was a vixen when she went to schoole, And though she be but little, she is fierce   Her. Little againe? Nothing but low and little? Why will you suffer her to flout me thus? Let me come to her   Lys. Get you gone you dwarfe, You minimus, of hindring knot-grasse made, You bead, you acorne   Dem. You are too officious, In her behalfe that scornes your seruices. Let her alone, speake not of Helena, Take not her part. For if thou dost intend Neuer so little shew of loue to her, Thou shalt abide it   Lys. Now she holds me not, Now follow if thou dar'st, to try whose right, Of thine or mine is most in Helena   Dem. Follow? Nay, Ile goe with thee cheeke by iowle. Exit Lysander and Demetrius.
  Her. You Mistris, all this coyle is long of you. Nay, goe not backe   Hel. I will not trust you I, Nor longer stay in your curst companie. Your hands then mine, are quicker for a fray, My legs are longer though to runne away. Enter Oberon and Pucke.  Ob. This is thy negligence, still thou mistak'st, Or else committ'st thy knaueries willingly   Puck. Beleeue me, King of shadowes, I mistooke, Did not you tell me, I should know the man, By the Athenian garments he hath on? And so farre blamelesse proues my enterprize, That I haue nointed an Athenians eies, And so farre am I glad, it so did sort, As this their iangling I esteeme a sport   Ob. Thou seest these Louers seeke a place to fight, Hie therefore Robin, ouercast the night, The starrie Welkin couer thou anon, With drooping fogge as blacke as Acheron, And lead these testie Riuals so astray, As one come not within anothers way. Like to Lysander, sometime frame thy tongue, Then stirre Demetrius vp with bitter wrong; And sometime raile thou like Demetrius; And from each other looke thou leade them thus, Till ore their browes, death-counterfeiting, sleepe With leaden legs, and Battie-wings doth creepe: Then crush this hearbe into Lysanders eie, Whose liquor hath this vertuous propertie, To take from thence all error, with his might, and make his eie-bals role with wonted sight. When they next wake, all this derision Shall seeme a dreame, and fruitless vision, And backe to Athens shall the Louers wend With league, whose date till death shall neuer end. Whiles I in this affaire do thee imploy, Ile to my Queene, and beg her Indian Boy; And then I will her charmed eie release From monsters view, and all things shall be peace   Puck. My Fairie Lord, this must be done with haste, For night-swift Dragons cut the Clouds full fast, And yonder shines Auroras harbinger; At whose approach Ghosts wandring here and there, Troope home to Church-yards; damned spirits all, That in crosse-waies and flouds haue buriall, Alreadie to their wormie beds are gone; For feare least day should looke their shames vpon, They wilfully themselues exile from light, And must for aye consort with blacke browd night   Ob. But we are spirits of another sort: I, with the mornings loue haue oft made sport, And like a Forrester, the groues may tread,
Euen till the Easterne gate all fierie red, Opening on Neptune, With faire blessed beames, Turnes into yellow gold, his salt greene streames. But not withstanding haste, make no delay: We may effect this businesse, yet ere day   Puck. Vp and downe, vp and downe, I will leade them vp and downe: I am fear'd in field and towne. Goblin, lead them vp and downe: here comes one. Enter Lysander.  Lys. Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speake thou now   Rob. Here villaine, drawne & readie. Where art thou?  Lys. I will be with thee straight   Rob. Follow me then to plainer ground. Enter Demetrius.  Dem. Lysander, speake againe; Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled? Speake in some bush: Where dost thou hide thy head?  Rob. Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars, Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars, And wilt not come? Come recreant, come thou childe, Ile whip thee with a rod. He is defil'd That drawes a sword on thee   Dem. Yea, art thou there?  Ro. Follow my voice, we'l try no manhood here. Enter.  Lys. He goes before me, and still dares me on, When I come where he cals, then he's gone. The Villaine is much lighter heel'd then I: I followed fast, but faster he did flye; shifting places. That fallen am I in darke vneuen way, And here wil rest me. Come thou gentle day: lye down. For if but once thou shew me thy gray light, Ile finde Demetrius, and reuenge this spight. Enter Robin and Demetrius.  Rob. Ho, ho, ho; coward, why com'st thou not?  Dem. Abide me, if thou dar'st. For well I wot, Thou runst before me, shifting euery place, And dar'st not stand, nor looke me in the face. Where art thou?  Rob. Come hither, I am here   Dem. Nay then thou mock'st me; thou shalt buy this deere, If euer I thy face by day-light see.
Now goe thy way: faintnesse constraineth me, To measure out my length on this cold bed, By daies approach looke to be visited. Enter Helena.  Hel. O weary night, O long and tedious night, Abate thy houres, shine comforts from the East, That I may backe to Athens by day-light, From these that my poore companie detest; And sleepe that sometime shuts vp sorrowes eie, Steale me a while from mine owne companie. Sleepe.  Rob. Yet but three? Come one more, Two of both kindes makes vp foure. Here she comes, curst and sad, Cupid is a knauish lad, Enter Hermia. Thus to make poore females mad   Her. Neuer so wearie, neuer so in woe, Bedabbled with the dew, and torne with briars, I can no further crawle, no further goe; My legs can keepe no pace with my desires. Here will I rest me till the breake of day, Heauens shield Lysander, if they meane a fray   Rob. On the ground sleepe sound, Ile apply your eie gentle louer, remedy. When thou wak'st, thou tak'st True delight in the sight of thy former Ladies eye, And the Country Prouerb knowne, That euery man should take his owne, In your waking shall be showne. Iacke shall haue Iill, nought shall goe ill. The man shall haue his Mare againe, and all shall bee well. They sleepe all the Act.
Actus Quartus. Enter Queene of Fairies, and Clowne, and Fairies, and the King behinde them.  Tita. Come, sit thee downe vpon this flowry bed, While I thy amiable cheekes doe coy, And sticke muske roses in thy sleeke smoothe head, And kisse thy faire large eares, my gentle ioy   Clow. Where's Peaseblossome?  Peas. Ready   Clow. Scratch my head, Pease-blossome. Wher's Mounsieuer Cobweb
   Cob. Ready   Clowne. Mounsieur Cobweb, good Mounsier get your weapons in your hand, & kill me a red hipt humble-Bee, on the top of a thistle; and good Mounsieur bring mee the hony bag. Doe not fret your selfe too much in the action, Mounsieur; and good mounsieur haue a care the hony bag breake not, I would be loth to haue you ouerflowne with a hony-bag signiour. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?  Mus. Ready   Clo. Giue me your neafe, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you leaue your courtesie good Mounsieur   Mus. What's your will?  Clo. Nothing good Mounsieur, but to help Caualery Cobweb to scratch. I must to the Barbers Mounsieur, for me-thinkes I am maruellous hairy about the face. And I am such a tender asse, if my haire do but tickle me, I must scratch   Tita. What, wilt thou heare some musicke, my sweet loue   Clow. I haue a reasonable good eare in musicke. Let vs haue the tongs and the bones. Musicke Tongs, Rurall Musicke.  Tita. Or say sweete Loue, what thou desirest to eat   Clowne. Truly a pecke of Prouender; I could munch your good dry Oates. Me-thinkes I haue a great desire to a bottle of hay: good hay, sweete hay hath no fellow   Tita. I haue a venturous Fairy, That shall seeke the Squirrels hoard, And fetch thee new Nuts   Clown. I had rather haue a handfull or two of dried pease. But I pray you let none of your people stirre me, I haue an exposition of sleepe come vpon me   Tyta. Sleepe thou, and I will winde thee in my arms, Fairies be gone, and be alwaies away. So doth the woodbine, the sweet Honisuckle, Gently entwist; the female Iuy so Enrings the barky fingers of the Elme. O how I loue thee! how I dote on thee! Enter Robin goodfellow and Oberon.  Ob. Welcome good Robin: Seest thou this sweet sight? Her dotage now I doe begin to pitty. For meeting her of late behinde the wood, Seeking sweet sauours for this hatefull foole, I did vpbraid her, and fall out with her.
For she his hairy temples then had rounded, With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers. And that same dew which somtime on the buds, Was wont to swell like round and orient pearles; Stood now within the pretty flouriets eyes, Like teares that did their owne disgrace bewaile. When I had at my pleasure taunted her, And she in milde termes beg'd my patience, I then did aske of her, her changeling childe, Which straight she gaue me, and her fairy sent To beare him to my Bower in Fairy Land. And now I haue the Boy, I will vndoe This hatefull imperfection of her eyes. And gentle Pucke, take this transformed scalpe, From off the head of this Athenian swaine; That he awaking when the other doe, May all to Athens backe againe repaire, And thinke no more of this nights accidents, But as the fierce vexation of dreame. But first I will release the Fairy Queene. Be thou as thou wast wont to be; See as thou wast wont to see. Dians bud, or Cupids flower, Hath such force and blessed power. Now my Titania wake you my sweet Queene   Tita. My Oberon, what visions haue I seene! Me-thought I was enamoured of an asse   Ob. There lies your loue   Tita. How came these things to passe? Oh, how mine eyes doth loath this visage now!  Ob. Silence a while. Robin take off his head: Titania, musick call, and strike more dead Then common sleepe; of all these, fine the sense   Tita. Musicke, ho musicke, such as charmeth sleepe. Musick still.  Rob. When thou wak'st, with thine owne fooles eies peepe   Ob. Sound musick; come my Queen, take hands with me And rocke the ground whereon these sleepers be. Now thou and I new in amity, And will to morrow midnight, solemnly Dance in Duke Theseus house triumphantly, And blesse it to all faire posterity. There shall the paires of faithfull Louers be Wedded, with Theseus, all in iollity   Rob. Faire King attend, and marke, I doe heare the morning Larke,  Ob. Then my Queene in silence sad, Trip we after the nights shade; We the Globe can compasse soone, Swifter then the wandering Moone
   Tita. Come my Lord, and in our flight, Tell me how it came this night, That I sleeping heere was found, Sleepers Lye still. With these mortals on the ground. Exeunt. Winde Hornes. Enter Theseus, Egeus, Hippolita and all his traine.  Thes. Goe one of you, finde out the Forrester, For now our obseruation is perform'd; And since we haue the vaward of the day, My Loue shall heare the musicke of my hounds. Vncouple in the Westerne valley, let them goe; Dispatch I say, and finde the Forrester. We will faire Queene, vp to the Mountains top, And marke the musicall confusion Of hounds and eccho in coniunction   Hip. I was with Hercules and Cadmus once. When in a wood of Creete they bayed the Beare With hounds of Sparta; neuer did I heare Such gallant chiding. For besides the groues, The skies, the fountaines, euery region neere, Seeme all one mutuall cry. I neuer heard So musicall a discord, such sweet thunder   Thes. My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kinde, So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung With eares that sweepe away the morning dew, Crooke kneed, and dew-lapt, like Thessalian Buls, Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bels, Each vnder each. A cry more tuneable Was neuer hallowed to, nor cheer'd with horne, In Creete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly; Iudge when you heare. But soft, what nimphs are these?  Egeus. My Lord, this is my daughter heere asleepe, And this Lysander, this Demetrius is, This Helena, olde Nedars Helena, I wonder of this being heere together   The. No doubt they rose vp early, to obserue The right of May; and hearing our intent, Came heere in grace of our solemnity. But speake Egeus, is not this the day That Hermia should giue answer of her choice?  Egeus. It is, my Lord   Thes. Goe bid the hunts-men wake them with their hornes. Hornes and they wake.
Shout within, they all start vp.  Thes. Good morrow friends: Saint Valentine is past, Begin these wood birds but to couple now?  Lys. Pardon my Lord   Thes. I pray you all stand vp. I know you two are Riuall enemies. How comes this gentle concord in the world, That hatred is so farre from iealousie, To sleepe by hate, and feare no enmity   Lys. My Lord, I shall reply amazedly, Halfe sleepe, halfe waking. but as yet, I sweare, I cannot truly say how I came heere. But as I thinke (for truly would I speake) And now I doe bethinke me, so it is; I came with Hermia hither. Our intent Was to be gone from Athens, where we might be Without the perill of the Athenian Law   Ege. Enough, enough, my Lord: you haue enough; I beg the Law, the Law, vpon his head: They would have stolne away, they would Demetrius, Thereby to haue defeated you and me: You of your wife, and me of my consent; Of my consent, that she should be your wife   Dem. My Lord, faire Helen told me of their stealth, Of this their purpose hither, to this wood, And I in furie hither followed them; Faire Helena, in fancy followed me. But my good Lord, I wot not by what not by what power, (But by some power it is) my loue To Hermia (melted as the snow) Seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaude, Which in my childehood I did doat vpon: And all the faith, the vertue of my heart, The obiect and the pleasure of mine eye, Is onely Helena. To her, my Lord, Was I betroth'd, ere I see Hermia, But like a sickenesse did I loath this food, But as in health, come to my naturall taste, Now doe I wish it, loue it, long for it, And will for euermore be true to it   Thes. Faire Louers, you are fortunately met; Of this discourse we shall heare more anon. Egeus, I will ouer-beare your will; For in the Temple, by and by with vs, These couples shall eternally be knit. And for the morning now is something worne, Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside. Away, with vs to Athens; three and three, Wee'll hold a feast in great solemnitie. Come Hippolita. Exit Duke and Lords.
  Dem. These things seeme small & vndistinguishable, Like farre off mountaines turned into Clouds   Her. Me-thinks I see these things with parted eye, When euery thing seemes double   Hel. So me-thinkes: And I haue found Demetrius, like a iewell, Mine owne, and not mine owne   Dem. It seemes to mee, That yet we sleepe, we dreame. Do not you thinke, The Duke was heere, and bid vs follow him?  Her. Yea, and my Father   Hel. And Hippolita   Lys. And he bid vs follow to the Temple   Dem. Why then we are awake; lets follow him, and by the way let vs recount our dreames. Bottome wakes. Exit Louers.  Clo. When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is, most faire Piramus. Hey ho. Peter Quince? Flute the bellowes-mender? Snout the tinker? Starueling? Gods my life! Stolne hence, and left me asleepe: I haue had a most rare vision. I had a dreame, past the wit of man, to say, what dreame it was. Man is but an Asse, if he goe about to expound this dreame. Me-thought I was, there is no man can tell what. Me-thought I was, and me-thought I had. But man is but a patch'd foole, if he will offer to say, what me-thought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the eare of man hath not seen, mans hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceiue, nor his heart to report, what my dreame was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballet of this dreame, it shall be called Bottomes Dreame, because it hath no bottome; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peraduenture, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death. Enter. Enter Quince, Flute, Thisbie, Snout, and Starueling.  Quin. Haue you sent to Bottomes house? Is he come home yet?  Staru. He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt hee is transported   This. If he come not, then the play is mar'd. It goes not forward, doth it?  Quin. It is not possible: you haue not a man in all Athens, able to discharge Piramus but he   This. No, hee hath simply the best wit of any handycraft
man in Athens   Quin. Yea, and the best person too, and hee is a very Paramour, for a sweet voyce   This. You must say, Paragon. A Paramour is (God blesse vs) a thing of nought. Enter Snug the Ioyner.  Snug. Masters, the Duke is comming from the Temple, and there is two or three Lords & Ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had all bin made men   This. O sweet bully Bottome: thus hath he lost sixepence a day, during his life; he could not haue scaped sixpence a day. And the Duke had not giuen him sixpence a day for playing Piramus, Ile be hang'd. He would haue deserued it. Sixpence a day in Piramus, or nothing. Enter Bottome.  Bot. Where are these Lads? Where are these hearts?  Quin. Bottome, o most couragious day! O most happie houre!  Bot. Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me not what. For if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I will tell you euery thing as it fell out   Qu. Let vs heare, sweet Bottome   Bot. Not a word of me: all that I will tell you, is, that the Duke hath dined. Get your apparell together, good strings to your beards, new ribbands to your pumps, meete presently at the Palace, euery man looke ore his part: for the short and the long is, our play is preferred: In any case let Thisby haue cleane linnen: and let not him that playes the Lion, paire his nailes, for they shall hang out for the Lions clawes. And most deare Actors, eate no Onions, nor Garlicke; for wee are to vtter sweete breath, and I doe not doubt but to heare them say, it is a sweet Comedy. No more words: away, go away. Exeunt.
Actus Quintus. Enter Theseus, Hippolita, Egeus and his Lords.  Hip. 'Tis strange my Theseus, y these louers speake of   The. More strange then true. I neuer may beleeue These anticke fables, nor these Fairy toyes, Louers and mad men haue such seething braines, Such shaping phantasies, that apprehend more Then coole reason euer comprehends. The Lunaticke, the Louer, and the Poet, Are of imagination all compact. One sees more diuels then vaste hell can hold;
That is the mad man. The Louer, all as franticke, Sees Helens beauty in a brow of Egipt. The Poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling, doth glance From heauen to earth, from earth to heauen. And as imagination bodies forth the forms of things Vnknowne; the Poets pen turnes them to shapes, And giues to aire nothing, a locall habitation, And a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination, That if it would but apprehend some ioy, It comprehends some bringer of that ioy. Or in the night, imagining some feare, Howe easie is a bush suppos'd a Beare?  Hip. But all the storie of the night told ouer, And all their minds transfigur'd so together, More witnesseth than fancies images, And growes to something of great constancie; But howsoeuer, strange, and admirable. Enter louers, Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.  The. Heere come the louers, full of ioy and mirth: Ioy, gentle friends, ioy and fresh dayes Of loue accompany your hearts   Lys. More then to vs, waite in your royall walkes, your boord, your bed   The. Come now, what maskes, what dances shall we haue, To weare away this long age of three houres, Between our after supper, and bed-time? Where is our vsuall manager of mirth? What Reuels are in hand? Is there no play, To ease the anguish of a torturing houre? Call Egeus   Ege. Heere mighty Theseus   The. Say, what abridgement haue you for this euening? What maske? What musicke? How shall we beguile The lazie time, if not with some delight?  Ege. There is a breefe how many sports are rife: Make choise of which your Highnesse will see first   Lis. The battell with the Centaurs to be sung By an Athenian Eunuch, to the Harpe   The. Wee'l none of that. That haue I told my Loue In glory of my kinsman Hercules   Lis. The riot of the tipsie Bachanals, Tearing the Thracian singer, in their rage?  The. That is an old deuice, and it was plaid When I from Thebes came last a Conqueror   Lis. The thrice three Muses, mourning for the death of learning, late deceast in beggerie   The. That is some Satire keene and criticall, Not sorting with a nuptiall ceremonie
   Lis. A tedious breefe Scene of yong Piramus, And his loue Thisby; very tragicall mirth   The. Merry and tragicall? Tedious, and briefe? That is, hot ice, and wondrous strange snow. How shall wee finde the concord of this discord?  Ege. A play there is, my Lord, some ten words long, Which is as breefe, as I haue knowne a play; But by ten words, my Lord, it is too long; Which makes it tedious. For in all the play, There is not one word apt, one Player fitted. And tragicall my noble Lord it is: for Piramus Therein doth kill himselfe. Which when I saw Rehearst, I must confesse, made mine eyes water: But more merrie teares, the passion of loud laughter Neuer shed   Thes. What are they that do play it?  Ege. Hard handed men, that worke in Athens heere, Which neuer labour'd in their mindes till now; And now haue toyled their vnbreathed memories With this same play, against your nuptiall   The. And we will heare it   Hip. No my noble Lord, it is not for you. I haue heard It ouer, and it is nothing, nothing in the world; Vnless you can finde sport in their intents, Extreamely stretched, and cond with cruell paine, To doe you seruice   Thes. I will heare that play. For neuer any thing Can be amisse, when simplenesse and duty tender it. Goe bring them in, and take your places, Ladies   Hip. I loue not to see wretchednesse orecharged; And duty in his seruice perishing   Thes. Why gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing   Hip. He saies, they can doe nothing in this kinde   Thes. The kinder we, to giue them thanks for nothing Our sport shall be, to take what they mistake; And what poore duty cannot doe, noble respect Takes it in might, not merit. Where I haue come, great Clearkes haue purposed To greete me with premeditated welcomes; Where I haue seene them shiuer and looke pale, Make periods in the midst of sentences, Throttle their practiz'd accent in their feares, And in conclusion, dumbly haue broke off, Not paying me a welcome. Trust me sweete, Out of this silence yet, I pickt a welcome: And in the modesty of fearefull duty, I read as much, as from the ratling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence. Loue therefore, and tongue-tide simplicity,
In least, speake most, to my capacity   Egeus. So please your Grace, the Prologue is addrest   Duke. Let him approach. Flor. Trum. Enter the Prologue. Quince.  Pro. If we offend, it is with our good will. That you should thinke, we come not to offend, But with good will. To shew our simple skill, That is the true beginning of our end. Consider then, we come but in despight. We do not come, as minding to content you, Our true intent is. All for your delight, We are not heere. That you should here repent you, The Actors are at hand; and by their show, You shall know all, that you are like to know   Thes. This fellow doth not stand vpon points   Lys. He hath rid his Prologue, like a rough Colt: he knowes not the stop. A good morall my lord. it is not enough to speake, but to speake true   Hip. Indeed hee hath plaid on his Prologue, like a childe on a Recorder, a sound, but not in gouernment   Thes. His speech was like a tangled chaine: nothing impaired, but all disordered. Who is next? Tawyer with a Trumpet before them. Enter Pyramus and Thisby, Wall, Moone-shine, and Lyon.  Prol. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show, But wonder on, till truth make all things plaine. This man is Piramus, if you would know; This beauteous Lady, Thisby is certaine. This man, with lyme and rough-cast, doth present Wall, that vile wall, which did these louers sunder: And through walls chink (poor soules) they are content To whisper. At the which, let no man wonder. This man, with Lanthorne, dog, and bush of thorne, Presenteth moone-shine. For if you will know, By moone-shine did these Louers thinke no scorne To meet at Ninus toombe, there, there to wooe: This grizly beast (which Lyon hight by name) The trusty Thisby, comming first by night, Did scarre away, or rather did affright: And as she fled, her mantle she did fall; Which Lyon vile with bloody mouth did staine. Anon comes Piramus, sweet youth and tall, And findes his Thisbies Mantle slaine; Whereat, with blade, with bloody blamefull blade, He brauely broacht his boiling bloudy breast, And Thisby, tarrying in Mulberry shade,
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest, Let Lyon, Moone-shine, Wall, and Louers twaine, At large discourse, while here they doe remaine. Exit all but Wall.  Thes. I wonder if the Lion be to speake   Deme. No wonder, my Lord: one Lion may, when many Asses doe. Exit Lyon, Thisbie, and Mooneshine.  Wall. In this same Interlude, it doth befall, That I, one Snowt (by name) present a wall: And such a wall, as I would haue you thinke, That had in it a crannied hole or chinke: Through which the Louers, Piramus and Thisbie Did whisper often, very secretly. This loame, this rough-cast, and this stone doth shew, That I am that same Wall; the truth is so. And this the cranny is, right and sinister, Through which the fearfull Louers are to whisper   Thes. Would you desire Lime and Haire to speake better?  Deme. It is the wittiest partition, that euer I heard discourse, my Lord   Thes. Pyramus drawes neere the Wall, silence. Enter Pyramus.  Pir. O grim lookt night, o night with hue so blacke, O night, which euer art, when day is not: O night, o night, alacke, alacke, alacke, I feare my Thisbies promise is forgot. And thou o wall, thou sweet and louely wall, That stands between her fathers ground and mine, Thou wall, o Wall, o sweet and louely wall, Shew me thy chinke, to blinke through with mine eine. Thankes courteous wall. Ioue shield thee well for this. But what see I? No Thisbie doe I see. O wicked wall, through whom I see no blisse, Curst be thy stones for thus deceiuing mee   Thes. The wall me-thinkes being sensible, should curse againe   Pir. No in truth sir, he should not. Deceiuing me, Is Thisbies cue; she is to enter, and I am to spy Her through the wall. You shall see it will fall. Enter Thisbie. Pat as I told you; yonder she comes   This. O wall, full often hast thou heard my mones, For parting my faire Piramus, and me My cherry lips haue often kist thy stones; Thy stones with Lime and Haire knit vp in thee
   Pyra. I see a voyce; now will I to the chinke, To spy and I can heare my Thisbies face. Thisbie?  This. My Loue thou art, my Loue I thinke   Pir. Thinke what thou wilt, I am thy Louers grace, And like Limander am I trusty still   This. And like Helen till the Fates me kill   Pir. Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true   This. As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you   Pir. O kisse me through the hole of this vile wall   This. I kisse the wals hole, not your lips at all   Pir. Wilt thou at Ninnies tombe meete me straight way?  This. Tide life, tide death, I come without delay   Wall. Thus haue I Wall, my part discharged so; And being done, thus Wall away doth go. Exit Clow.  Du. Now is the morall downe between the two Neighbours   Dem. No remedie my Lord, when Wals are so wilfull, to heare without warning   Dut. This is the silliest stuffe that ere I heard   Du. The best in this kind are but shadowes, and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them   Dut. It must be your imagination then, & not theirs   Duk. If wee imagine no worse of them then they of themselues, they may passe for excellent men. Here com two noble beasts, in a man and a Lion. Enter Lyon and Moone-shine   Lyon. You Ladies, you (whose gentle harts do feare The smallest monstrous mouse that creepes on floore) May now perchance, both quake and tremble heere, When Lion rough in wildest rage doth roare. Then know that I, one Snug the Ioyner am A Lion fell, nor else no Lions dam: For if I should as Lion come in strife Into this place, 'twere pittie of my life   Du. A verie gentle beast, and of good conscience   Dem. The verie best at a beast, my Lord, y ere I saw   Lis. This Lion is a verie Fox for his valor
   Du. True, and a Goose for his discretion   Dem. Not so my Lord: for his valor cannot carrie his discretion, and the fox carries the Goose   Du. His discretion I am sure cannot carrie his valor: for the Goose carries not the Fox. It is well; leaue it to his discretion, and let vs hearken to the Moone   Moone. This Lanthorne doth the horned Moone present   De. He should haue worne the hornes on his head   Du. Hee is no crescent, and his hornes are inuisible, within the circumference   Moon. This lanthorne doth the horned Moone present: My selfe, the man i'th Moone doth seeme to be   Du. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man Should be put into the Lanthorne. How is it els the man i'th Moone?  Dem. He dares not come there for the candle. For you see, it is already in snuffe   Dut. I am wearie of this Moone; would he would change   Du. It appeares by his smal light of discretion, that he is in the wane: but yet in courtesie, in all reason, we must stay the time   Lys. Proceed Moone   Moon. All that I haue to say, is to tell you, that the Lanthorne is the Moone; I, the man in the Moone; this thorne bush; my thorne bush; and this dog, my dog   Dem. Why all these should be in the Lanthorne: for they are in the Moone. But silence, heere comes Thisby. Enter Thisby.  This. This is old Ninnies tombe: where is my loue?  Lyon. Oh. The Lion roares, Thisby runs off.  Dem. Well roar'd Lion   Du. Well run Thisby   Dut. Well shone Moone. Truly the Moone shines with a good grace   Du. Wel mouz'd Lion   Dem. And then came Piramus
   Lys. And so the Lion vanisht. Enter Piramus.  Pyr. Sweet Moone, I thank thee for thy sunny beames, I thanke thee Moone, for shining now so bright: For by thy gracious, golden, glittering beames, I trust to taste of truest Thisbies sight. But stay: O spight! but marke, poore Knight, What dreadful dole is heere? Eyes do you see! How can it be! O dainty Ducke: O Deere! Thy mantle good; what staind with blood! Approch you furies fell: O Fates! come, come: Cut thred and thrum, Quaile, crush, conclude, and quell   Du. This passion, and the death of a deare friend, Would go neere to make a man looke sad   Dut. Beshrew my heart, but I pittie the man   Pir. O wherefore Nature, did'st thou Lions frame? Since lion vilde hath heere deflour'd my deere: Which is: no, no, which was the fairest Dame That liu'd, that lou'd, that like'd, that look'd with cheere. Come teares, confound: Out sword, and wound The pap of Piramus: I, that left pap, where heart doth hop; Thus dye I, thus, thus, thus. Now am I dead, now am I fled, my soule is in the sky, Tongue lose thy light, Moone take thy flight, Now dye, dye, dye, dye, dye   Dem. No Die, but an ace for him; for he is but one   Lis. Lesse then an ace man. For he is dead, he is nothing   Du. With the helpe of a Surgeon, he might yet recouer, and proue an Asse   Dut. How chance Moone-shine is gone before? Thisby comes backe, and findes her Louer. Enter Thisby.  Duke. She wil finde him by starre-light. Heere she comes, and her passion ends the play   Dut. Me thinkes shee should not vse a long one for such a Piramus: I hope she will be breefe   Dem. A Moth wil turne the ballance, which Piramus which Thisby is the better   Lys. She hath spyed him already, with those sweete eyes   Dem. And thus she meanes, videlicit   This. Asleepe my Loue? What, dead my Doue? O Piramus arise:
Speake, speake. Quite dumbe? Dead, dead? A tombe Must couer thy sweet eyes. These Lilly Lips, this cherry nose, These yellow Cowslip cheekes Are gone, are gone: Louers make mone: His eyes were greene as Leekes. O Sisters three, come, come to mee, With hands as pale as Milke, Lay them in gore, since you haue shore with sheeres, his thred of silke. Tongue not a word: Come trusty sword: Come blade, my brest imbrue: And farwell friends, thus Thisbie ends; Adieu, adieu, adieu   Duk. Moone-shine & Lion are left to burie the dead   Deme. I, and Wall too   Bot. No, I assure you, the wall is downe, that parted their Fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue, or to heare a Bergomask dance, betweene two of our company?  Duk. No Epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Neuer excuse; for when the plaiers are all dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if hee that writ it had plaid Piramus, and hung himselfe in Thisbies garter, it would haue beene a fine Tragedy: and so it is truely, and very notably discharg'd. but come, your Burgomaske; let your Epilogue alone. The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelue. Louers to bed, 'tis almost Fairy time. I feare we shall out-sleepe the comming morne, As much as we this night haue ouer-watcht. This palpable grosse play hath well beguil'd The heauy gate of night. Sweet friends to bed. A fortnight hold we this solemnity. In nightly Reuels; and new iollitie. Exeunt. Enter Pucke.  Puck. Now the hungry Lyons rores, And the Wolfe beholds the Moone: Whilest the heauy ploughman snores, All with weary taske fore-done. Now the wasted brands doe glow, Whil'st the scritch-owle, scritching loud, Puts the wretch that lies in woe, In remembrance of a shrowd. Now it is the time of night, That the graues, all gaping wide, Euery one lets forth his spright, In the Church-way paths to glide, And we Fairies, that do runne, By the triple Hecates teame, From the presence of the Sunne, Following darkenesse like a dreame, Now are frollicke; not a Mouse
Shall disturbe this hallowed house. I am sent with broome before, To sweep the dust behinde the doore. Enter King and Queene of Fairies, with their traine.  Ob. Through the house giue glimmering light, By the dead and drowsie fier, Euerie Elfe and Fairie spright, Hop as light as bird from brier, And this Ditty after me, sing and dance it trippinglie,  Tita. First rehearse this song by roate, To each word a warbling note. Hand in hand, with Fairie grace, Will we sing and blesse this place. The Song. Now vntill the breake of day, Through this house each Fairy stray. To the best Bride-bed will we, Which by vs shall blessed be: And the issue there create, Euer shall be fortunate: So shall all the couples three, Euer true in louing be: And the blots of Natures hand, Shall not in their issue stand. Neuer mole, harelip, nor scarre, nor mark prodigious, such as are Despised in Natiuitie, Shall vpon their children be. With this field dew consecrate, Euery Fairy take his gate, And each seuerall chamber blesse, Through this Pallace with sweet peace, Euer shall in safety rest. And the owner of it blest. Trip away, make no stay; Meet me all by breake of day   Robin. If we shadowes haue offended, Thinke but this (and all is mended) That you haue but slumbred heere, While these Visions did appeare. And this weake and idle theame, No more yeelding but a dreame, Gentles, doe not reprehend. If you pardon, we will mend. And as I am an honest Pucke, If we haue vnearned lucke, Now to scape the Serpents tongue, We will make amends ere long: Else the Pucke a lyar call. So good night vnto you all. Giue me your hands, if we be friends, And Robin shall restore amends. FINIS. A MIDSOMMER Nights Dreame.

Paradise Lost 
2 of 374 
Book I  
Of Mans first disobedience, and the fruit  Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste  Brought death into the World, and all our woe,  With loss of Eden, till one greater Man  Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,  Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top  Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire  That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed  In the beginning how the heavens and earth  Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill  Delight thee more, and Siloas brook that flowed  Fast by the oracle of God, I thence  Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,  That with no middle flight intends to soar  Above th Aonian mount, while it pursues  Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.  And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer  Before all temples th upright heart and pure,  Instruct me, for thou knowst; thou from the first  Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread,  Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss,  And madst it pregnant: what in me is dark  Illumine, what is low raise and support;  That, to the height of this great argument,  I may assert Eternal Providence,  And justify the ways of God to men.  
Paradise Lost 
3 of 374 
Say firstfor Heaven hides nothing from thy view,  Nor the deep tract of Hellsay first what cause  Moved our grand parents, in that happy state,  Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off  From their Creator, and transgress his will  For one restraint, lords of the World besides.  Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?  Th infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile,  Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived  The mother of mankind, what time his pride  Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host  Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring  To set himself in glory above his peers,  He trusted to have equalled the Most High,  If he opposed, and with ambitious aim  Against the throne and monarchy of God,  Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud,  With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power  Hurled headlong flaming from th ethereal sky,  With hideous ruin and combustion, down  To bottomless perdition, there to dwell  In adamantine chains and penal fire,  Who durst defy th Omnipotent to arms.  Nine times the space that measures day and night  To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew,  Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf,  Confounded, though immortal. But his doom  Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought  Both of lost happiness and lasting pain

Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes,  That witnessed huge affliction and dismay,  Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.  At once, as far as Angels ken, he views  The dismal situation waste and wild.  A dungeon horrible, on all sides round,  As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames  No light; but rather darkness visible  Served only to discover sights of woe,  Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace  And rest can never dwell, hope never comes  That comes to all, but torture without end  Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed  With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.  Such place Eternal Justice has prepared  For those rebellious; here their prison ordained  In utter darkness, and their portion set,  As far removed from God and light of Heaven  As from the centre thrice to th utmost pole.  Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!  There the companions of his fall, oerwhelmed  With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,  He soon discerns; and, weltering by his side,  One next himself in power, and next in crime,  Long after known in Palestine, and named  Beelzebub. To whom th Arch-Enemy,  And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words  Breaking the horrid silence, thus began:  If thou beest hebut O how fallen! how changed

From him who, in the happy realms of light  Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine  Myriads, though bright!if he whom mutual league,  United thoughts and counsels, equal hope  And hazard in the glorious enterprise  Joined with me once, now misery hath joined  In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest  From what height fallen: so much the stronger proved  He with his thunder; and till then who knew  The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those,  Nor what the potent Victor in his rage  Can else inflict, do I repent, or change,  Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind,  And high disdain from sense of injured merit,  That with the Mightiest raised me to contend,  And to the fierce contentions brought along  Innumerable force of Spirits armed,  That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,  His utmost power with adverse power opposed  In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven,  And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?  All is not lostthe unconquerable will,  And study of revenge, immortal hate,  And courage never to submit or yield:  And what is else not to be overcome?  That glory never shall his wrath or might  Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace  With suppliant knee, and deify his power  Who, from the terror of this arm, so late

Doubted his empirethat were low indeed;  That were an ignominy and shame beneath  This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods,  And this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail;  Since, through experience of this great event,  In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,  We may with more successful hope resolve  To wage by force or guile eternal war,  Irreconcilable to our grand Foe,  Who now triumphs, and in th excess of joy  Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven.  So spake th apostate Angel, though in pain,  Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;  And him thus answered soon his bold compeer:  O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers  That led th embattled Seraphim to war  Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds  Fearless, endangered Heavens perpetual King,  And put to proof his high supremacy,  Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate,  Too well I see and rue the dire event  That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat,  Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host  In horrible destruction laid thus low,  As far as Gods and heavenly Essences  Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains  Invincible, and vigour soon returns,  Though all our glory extinct, and happy state  Here swallowed up in endless misery.

But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now  Of force believe almighty, since no less  Than such could have oerpowered such force as ours)  Have left us this our spirit and strength entire,  Strongly to suffer and support our pains,  That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,  Or do him mightier service as his thralls  By right of war, whateer his business be,  Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire,  Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep?  What can it the avail though yet we feel  Strength undiminished, or eternal being  To undergo eternal punishment?  Whereto with speedy words th Arch-Fiend replied:  Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable,  Doing or suffering: but of this be sure  To do aught good never will be our task,  But ever to do ill our sole delight,  As being the contrary to his high will  Whom we resist. If then his providence  Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,  Our labour must be to pervert that end,  And out of good still to find means of evil;  Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps  Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb  His inmost counsels from their destined aim.  But see! the angry Victor hath recalled  His ministers of vengeance and pursuit  Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail,

Shot after us in storm, oerblown hath laid  The fiery surge that from the precipice  Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder,  Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage,  Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now  To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.  Let us not slip th occasion, whether scorn  Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.  Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild,  The seat of desolation, void of light,  Save what the glimmering of these livid flames  Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend  From off the tossing of these fiery waves;  There rest, if any rest can harbour there;  And, re-assembling our afflicted powers,  Consult how we may henceforth most offend  Our enemy, our own loss how repair,  How overcome this dire calamity,  What reinforcement we may gain from hope,  If not, what resolution from despair.  Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate,  With head uplift above the wave, and eyes  That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides  Prone on the flood, extended long and large,  Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge  As whom the fables name of monstrous size,  Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove,  Briareos or Typhon, whom the den  By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast

Leviathan, which God of all his works  Created hugest that swim th ocean-stream.  Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam,  The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,  Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,  With fixed anchor in his scaly rind,  Moors by his side under the lee, while night  Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.  So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay,  Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence  Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will  And high permission of all-ruling Heaven  Left him at large to his own dark designs,  That with reiterated crimes he might  Heap on himself damnation, while he sought  Evil to others, and enraged might see  How all his malice served but to bring forth  Infinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn  On Man by him seduced, but on himself  Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured.  Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool  His mighty stature; on each hand the flames  Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and,rolled  In billows, leave i th midst a horrid vale.  Then with expanded wings he steers his flight  Aloft, incumbent on the dusky air,  That felt unusual weight; till on dry land  He lightsif it were land that ever burned  With solid, as the lake with liquid fire,

And such appeared in hue as when the force  Of subterranean wind transprots a hill  Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side  Of thundering Etna, whose combustible  And fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire,  Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds,  And leave a singed bottom all involved  With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole  Of unblest feet. Him followed his next mate;  Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood  As gods, and by their own recovered strength,  Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.  Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,  Said then the lost Archangel, this the seat  That we must change for Heaven?this mournful gloom  For that celestial light? Be it so, since he  Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid  What shall be right: farthest from him is best  Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme  Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields,  Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,  Infernal world! and thou, profoundest Hell,  Receive thy new possessorone who brings  A mind not to be changed by place or time.  The mind is its own place, and in itself  Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.  What matter where, if I be still the same,  And what I should be, all but less than he  Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least

We shall be free; th Almighty hath not built  Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:  Here we may reigh secure; and, in my choice,  To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:  Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.  But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,  Th associates and co-partners of our loss,  Lie thus astonished on th oblivious pool,  And call them not to share with us their part  In this unhappy mansion, or once more  With rallied arms to try what may be yet  Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell?  So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub  Thus answered:Leader of those armies bright  Which, but th Omnipotent, none could have foiled!  If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge  Of hope in fears and dangersheard so oft  In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge  Of battle, when it raged, in all assaults  Their surest signalthey will soon resume  New courage and revive, though now they lie  Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire,  As we erewhile, astounded and amazed;  No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height!  He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend  Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield,  Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,  Behind him cast. The broad circumference  Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb

His spearto equal which the tallest pine  Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast  Of some great ammiral, were but a wand  He walked with, to support uneasy steps  Over the burning marl, not like those steps  On Heavens azure; and the torrid clime  Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire.  Nathless he so endured, till on the beach  Of that inflamed sea he stood, and called  His legionsAngel Forms, who lay entranced  Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks  In Vallombrosa, where th Etrurian shades  High over-arched embower; or scattered sedge  Afloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed  Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves oerthrew  Busiris and his Memphian chivalry,  While with perfidious hatred they pursued  The sojourners of Goshen, who beheld  From the safe shore their floating carcases  And broken chariot-wheels. So thick bestrown,  Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flood,  Under amazement of their hideous change.  He called so loud that all the hollow deep  Of Hell resounded:Princes, Potentates,  Warriors, the Flower of Heavenonce yours; now lost,

If such astonishment as this can seize  Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place  After the toil of battle to repose  Your wearied virtue, for the ease you find  To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven?  Or in this abject posture have ye sworn  To adore the Conqueror, who now beholds  Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood  With scattered arms and ensigns, till anon  His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern  Th advantage, and, descending, tread us down  Thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts  Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?  Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!  They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung  Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch  On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,  Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.  Nor did they not perceive the evil plight  In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;  Yet to their Generals voice they soon obeyed  Innumerable. As when the potent rod  Of Amrams son, in Egypts evil day,  Waved round the coast, up-called a pitchy cloud  Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind,  That oer the realm of impious Pharaoh hung  Like Night, and darkened all the land of Nile;  So numberless were those bad Angels seen  Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell,

Forthwith, form every squadron and each band,  The heads and leaders thither haste where stood  Their great Commandergodlike Shapes, and Forms  Excelling human; princely Dignities;  And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones,  Though on their names in Heavenly records now  Be no memorial, blotted out and rased  By their rebellion from the Books of Life.  Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve  Got them new names, till, wandering oer the earth,  Through Gods high sufferance for the trial of man,  By falsities and lies the greatest part  Of mankind they corrupted to forsake  God their Creator, and th invisible  Glory of him that made them to transform  Oft to the image of a brute, adorned  With gay religions full of pomp and gold,  And devils to adore for deities:  Then were they known to men by various names,

And various idols through the heathen world.  Say, Muse, their names then known, who first, who last,  Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch,  At their great Emperors call, as next in worth  Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,  While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?  The chief were those who, from the pit of Hell  Roaming to seek their prey on Earth, durst fix  Their seats, long after, next the seat of God,  Their altars by his altar, gods adored  Among the nations round, and durst abide  Jehovah thundering out of Sion, throned  Between the Cherubim; yea, often placed  Within his sanctuary itself their shrines,  Abominations; and with cursed things  His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned,  And with their darkness durst affront his light.  First, Moloch, horrid king, besmeared with blood  Of human sacrifice, and parents tears;  Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud,  Their childrens cries unheard that passed through fire  To his grim idol. Him the Ammonite  Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain,  In Argob and in Basan, to the stream  Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such  Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart  Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build  His temple right against the temple of God  On that opprobrious hill, and made his grove

The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence  And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell.  Next Chemos, th obscene dread of Moabs sons,  From Aroar to Nebo and the wild  Of southmost Abarim; in Hesebon  And Horonaim, Seons real, beyond  The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines,  And Eleale to th Asphaltic Pool:  Peor his other name, when he enticed  Israel in Sittim, on their march from Nile,  To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.  Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged  Even to that hill of scandal, by the grove  Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate,  Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.  With these came they who, from the bordering flood  Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts  Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names  Of Baalim and Ashtaroththose male,  These feminine. For Spirits, when they please,  Can either sex assume, or both; so soft  And uncompounded is their essence pure,  Not tried or manacled with joint or limb,  Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,  Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose,  Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure,  Can execute their airy purposes,  And works of love or enmity fulfil.  For those the race of Israel oft forsook

Their Living Strength, and unfrequented left  His righteous altar, bowing lowly down  To bestial gods; for which their heads as low  Bowed down in battle, sunk before the spear  Of despicable foes. With these in troop  Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians called  Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns;  To whose bright image nigntly by the moon  Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs;  In Sion also not unsung, where stood  Her temple on th offensive mountain, built  By that uxorious king whose heart, though large,  Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell  To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,  Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured  The Syrian damsels to lament his fate  In amorous ditties all a summers day,  While smooth Adonis from his native rock  Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood  Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale  Infected Sions daughters with like heat,  Whose wanton passions in the sacred proch  Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led,  His eye surveyed the dark idolatries  Of alienated Judah. Next came one  Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark  Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off,  In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge,  Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers:

Dagon his name, sea-monster,upward man  And downward fish; yet had his temple high  Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast  Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,  And Accaron and Gazas frontier bounds.  Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat  Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks  Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.  He also against the house of God was bold:  A leper once he lost, and gained a king  Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew  Gods altar to disparage and displace  For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn  His odious offerings, and adore the gods  Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared  A crew who, under names of old renown  Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train  With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused  Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek  Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms  Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape  Th infection, when their borrowed gold composed  The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king  Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,  Likening his Maker to the grazed ox  Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed  From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke  Both her first-born and all her bleating gods.  Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd  
Paradise Lost 
19 of 374 
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love  Vice for itself. To him no temple stood  Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he  In temples and at altars, when the priest  Turns atheist, as did Elis sons, who filled  With lust and violence the house of God?  In courts and palaces he also reigns,  And in luxurious cities, where the noise  Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,  And injury and outrage; and, when night  Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons  Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.  Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night  In Gibeah, when the hospitable door  Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.  These were the prime in order and in might:  The rest were long to tell; though far renowned  Th Ionian godsof Javans issue held  Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth,  Their boasted parents;Titan, Heavens first-born,  With his enormous brood, and birthright seized  By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove,  His own and Rheas son, like measure found;  So Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete  And Ida known, thence on the snowy top  Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air,  Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff,  Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds  Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old

Fled over Adria to th Hesperian fields,  And oer the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles.  All these and more came flocking; but with looks  Downcast and damp; yet such wherein appeared  Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief  Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost  In loss itself; which on his countenance cast  Like doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride  Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore  Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised  Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears.  Then straight commands that, at the warlike sound  Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared  His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed  Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall:  Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled  Th imperial ensign; which, full high advanced,  Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,  With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed,  Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while  Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds:  At which the universal host up-sent  A shout that tore Hells concave, and beyond  Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.  All in a moment through the gloom were seen  Ten thousand banners rise into the air,  With orient colours waving: with them rose  A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms  Appeared, and serried shields in thick array

Of depth immeasurable. Anon they move  In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood  Of flutes and soft recorderssuch as raised  To height of noblest temper heroes old  Arming to battle, and instead of rage  Deliberate valour breathed, firm, and unmoved  With dread of death to flight or foul retreat;  Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage  With solemn touches troubled thoughts, and chase  Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain  From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they,  Breathing united force with fixed thought,  Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed  Their painful steps oer the burnt soil. And now  Advanced in view they standa horrid front  Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise  Of warriors old, with ordered spear and shield,  Awaiting what command their mighty Chief  Had to impose. He through the armed files  Darts his experienced eye, and soon traverse  The whole battalion viewstheir order due,  Their visages and stature as of gods;  Their number last he sums. And now his heart  Distends with pride, and, hardening in his strength,  Glories: for never, since created Man,  Met such embodied force as, named with these,  Could merit more than that small infantry  Warred on by cranesthough all the giant brood  Of Phlegra with th heroic race were joined

That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side  Mixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds  In fable or romance of Uthers son,  Begirt with British and Armoric knights;  And all who since, baptized or infidel,  Jousted in Aspramont, or Montalban,  Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond,  Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore  When Charlemain with all his peerage fell  By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond  Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed  Their dread Commander. He, above the rest  In shape and gesture proudly eminent,  Stood like a tower. His form had yet not lost  All her original brightness, nor appeared  Less than Archangel ruined, and th excess  Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen  Looks through the horizontal misty air  Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the moon,  In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds  On half the nations, and with fear of change  Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shone  Above them all th Archangel: but his face  Deep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care  Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows  Of dauntless courage, and considerate pride  Waiting revenge. Cruel his eye, but cast  Signs of remorse and passion, to behold  The fellows of his crime, the followers rather

He now prepared  To speak; whereat their doubled ranks they bend  From wing to wing, and half enclose him round  With all his peers: attention held them mute.  Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn,  Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last  Words interwove with sighs found out their way:  O myriads of immortal Spirits! O Powers  Matchless, but with th Almighth!and that strife  Was not inglorious, though th event was dire,  As this place testifies, and this dire change,  Hateful to utter. But what power of mind,  Forseeing or presaging, from the depth  Of knowledge past or present, could have feared  How such united force of gods, how such  As stood like these, could ever know repulse?  For who can yet believe, though after loss,  That all these puissant legions, whose exile  Hath emptied Heaven, shall fail to re-ascend,  Self-raised, and repossess their native seat?  For me, be witness all the host of Heaven,

If counsels different, or danger shunned  By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns  Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure  Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute,  Consent or custom, and his regal state  Put forth at full, but still his strength concealed  Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.  Henceforth his might we know, and know our own,  So as not either to provoke, or dread  New war provoked: our better part remains  To work in close design, by fraud or guile,  What force effected not; that he no less  At length from us may find, who overcomes  By force hath overcome but half his foe.  Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife  There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long  Intended to create, and therein plant  A generation whom his choice regard  Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven.  Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps  Our first eruptionthither, or elsewhere;  For this infernal pit shall never hold  Celestial Spirits in bondage, nor th Abyss  Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts  Full counsel must mature. Peace is despaired;  For who can think submission? War, then, war  Open or understood, must be resolved.  He spake; and, to confirm his words, outflew  Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs

Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze  Far round illumined Hell. Highly they raged  Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms  Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war,  Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven.  There stood a hill not far, whose grisly top  Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire  Shone with a glossy scurfundoubted sign  That in his womb was hid metallic ore,  The work of sulphur. Thither, winged with speed,  A numerous brigade hastened: as when bands  Of pioneers, with spade and pickaxe armed,  Forerun the royal camp, to trench a field,  Or cast a rampart. Mammon led them on  Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell  From Heaven; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts  Were always downward bent, admiring more  The riches of heavens pavement, trodden gold,  Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed  In vision beatific. By him first  Men also, and by his suggestion taught,  Ransacked the centre, and with impious hands  Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth  For treasures better hid. Soon had his crew  Opened into the hill a spacious wound,  And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire  That riches grow in Hell; that soil may best  Deserve the precious bane. And here let those  Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell

Of Babel, and the works of Memphian kings,  Learn how their greatest monuments of fame  And strength, and art, are easily outdone  By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour  What in an age they, with incessant toil  And hands innumerable, scarce perform.  Nigh on the plain, in many cells prepared,  That underneath had veins of liquid fire  Sluiced from the lake, a second multitude  With wondrous art founded the massy ore,  Severing each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross.  A third as soon had formed within the ground  A various mould, and from the boiling cells  By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook;  As in an organ, from one blast of wind,  To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes.  Anon out of the earth a fabric huge  Rose like an exhalation, with the sound  Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet  Built like a temple, where pilasters round  Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid  With golden architrave; nor did there want  Cornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven;  The roof was fretted gold. Not Babylon  Nor great Alcairo such magnificence  Equalled in all their glories, to enshrine  Belus or Serapis their gods, or seat  Their kings, when Egypt with Assyria strove  In wealth and luxury. Th ascending pile

Stood fixed her stately height, and straight the doors,  Opening their brazen folds, discover, wide  Within, her ample spaces oer the smooth  And level pavement: from the arched roof,  Pendent by subtle magic, many a row  Of starry lamps and blazing cressets, fed  With naptha and asphaltus, yielded light  As from a sky. The hasty multitude  Admiring entered; and the work some praise,  And some the architect. His hand was known  In Heaven by many a towered structure high,  Where sceptred Angels held their residence,  And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King  Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,  Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright.  Nor was his name unheard or unadored  In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land  Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell  From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove  Sheer oer the crystal battlements: from morn  To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,  A summers day, and with the setting sun  Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star,  On Lemnos, th Aegaean isle. Thus they relate,  Erring; for he with this rebellious rout  Fell long before; nor aught aviled him now  To have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape  By all his engines, but was headlong sent,  With his industrious crew, to build in Hell.

Meanwhile the winged Heralds, by command  Of sovereign power, with awful ceremony  And trumpets sound, throughout the host proclaim  A solemn council forthwith to be held  At Pandemonium, the high capital  Of Satan and his peers. Their summons called  From every band and squared regiment  By place or choice the worthiest: they anon  With hundreds and with thousands trooping came  Attended. All access was thronged; the gates  And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall  (Though like a covered field, where champions bold  Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldans chair  Defied the best of Paynim chivalry  To mortal combat, or career with lance),  Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,  Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees  In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides.  Pour forth their populous youth about the hive  In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers  Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,  The suburb of their straw-built citadel,  New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer  Their state-affairs: so thick the airy crowd  Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given,  Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed  In bigness to surpass Earths giant sons,  Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room  Throng numberlesslike that pygmean race

Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves,  Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side  Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,  Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon  Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth  Wheels her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance  Intent, with jocund music charm his ear;  At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.  Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms  Reduced their shapes immense, and were at large,  Though without number still, amidst the hall  Of that infernal court. But far within,  And in their own dimensions like themselves,  The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim  In close recess and secret conclave sat,  A thousand demi-gods on golden seats,  Frequent and full. After short silence then,  And summons read, the great consult began.

Book II  
High on a throne of royal state, which far  Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind,  Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand  Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,  Satan exalted sat, by merit raised  To that bad eminence; and, from despair  Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires  Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue  Vain war with Heaven; and, by success untaught,  His proud imaginations thus displayed:  Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!  For, since no deep within her gulf can hold  Immortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen,  I give not Heaven for lost: from this descent  Celestial Virtues rising will appear  More glorious and more dread than from no fall,  And trust themselves to fear no second fate!  Me though just right, and the fixed laws of Heaven,  Did first create your leadernext, free choice  With what besides in council or in fight  Hath been achieved of merityet this loss,  Thus far at least recovered, hath much more  Established in a safe, unenvied throne,  Yielded with full consent. The happier state  In Heaven, which follows dignity, might draw  Envy from each inferior; but who here  
Paradise Lost 
31 of 374 
Will envy whom the highest place exposes  Foremost to stand against the Thunderers aim  Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share  Of endless pain? Where there is, then, no good  For which to strive, no strife can grow up there  From faction: for none sure will claim in Hell  Precedence; none whose portion is so small  Of present pain that with ambitious mind  Will covet more! With this advantage, then,  To union, and firm faith, and firm accord,  More than can be in Heaven, we now return  To claim our just inheritance of old,  Surer to prosper than prosperity  Could have assured us; and by what best way,  Whether of open war or covert guile,  We now debate. Who can advise may speak.  He ceased; and next him Moloch, sceptred king,  Stood upthe strongest and the fiercest Spirit  That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair.  His trust was with th Eternal to be deemed  Equal in strength, and rather than be less  Cared not to be at all; with that care lost  Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse,  He recked not, and these words thereafter spake:  My sentence is for open war. Of wiles,  More unexpert, I boast not: them let those  Contrive who need, or when they need; not now.  For, while they sit contriving, shall the rest  Millions that stand in arms, and longing wait

The signal to ascendsit lingering here,  Heavens fugitives, and for their dwelling-place  Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame,  The prison of his ryranny who reigns  By our delay? No! let us rather choose,  Armed with Hell-flames and fury, all at once  Oer Heavens high towers to force resistless way,  Turning our tortures into horrid arms  Against the Torturer; when, to meet the noise  Of his almighty engine, he shall hear  Infernal thunder, and, for lightning, see  Black fire and horror shot with equal rage  Among his Angels, and his throne itself  Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire,  His own invented torments. But perhaps  The way seems difficult, and steep to scale  With upright wing against a higher foe!  Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench  Of that forgetful lake benumb not still,  That in our porper motion we ascend  Up to our native seat; descent and fall  To us is adverse. Who but felt of late,  When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear  Insulting, and pursued us through the Deep,  With what compulsion and laborious flight  We sunk thus low? Th ascent is easy, then;  Th event is feared! Should we again provoke  Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find  To our destruction, if there be in Hell  
Paradise Lost 
33 of 374 
Fear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse  Than to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned  In this abhorred deep to utter woe!  Where pain of unextinguishable fire  Must exercise us without hope of end  The vassals of his anger, when the scourge  Inexorably, and the torturing hour,  Calls us to penance? More destroyed than thus,  We should be quite abolished, and expire.  What fear we then? what doubt we to incense  His utmost ire? which, to the height enraged,  Will either quite consume us, and reduce  To nothing this essentialhappier far  Than miserable to have eternal being!  Or, if our substance be indeed divine,  And cannot cease to be, we are at worst  On this side nothing; and by proof we feel  Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven,  And with perpetual inroads to alarm,  Though inaccessible, his fatal throne:  Which, if not victory, is yet revenge.  He ended frowning, and his look denounced  Desperate revenge, and battle dangerous  To less than gods. On th other side up rose  Belial, in act more graceful and humane.  A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed  For dignity composed, and high exploit.  But all was false and hollow; though his tongue  Dropped manna, and could make the worse appear  
Paradise Lost

The better reason, to perplex and dash  Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low  To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds  Timorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear,  And with persuasive accent thus began:  I should be much for open war, O Peers,  As not behind in hate, if what was urged  Main reason to persuade immediate war  Did not dissuade me most, and seem to cast  Ominous conjecture on the whole success;  When he who most excels in fact of arms,  In what he counsels and in what excels  Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair  And utter dissolution, as the scope  Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.  First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled  With armed watch, that render all access  Impregnable: oft on the bodering Deep  Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing  Scout far and wide into the realm of Night,  Scorning surprise. Or, could we break our way  By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise  With blackest insurrection to confound  Heavens purest light, yet our great Enemy,  All incorruptible, would on his throne  Sit unpolluted, and th ethereal mould,  Incapable of stain, would soon expel  Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire,  Victorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope  
Paradise Lost 
35 of 374 
Is flat despair: we must exasperate  Th Almighty Victor to spend all his rage;  And that must end us; that must be our cure  To be no more. Sad cure! for who would lose,  Though full of pain, this intellectual being,  Those thoughts that wander through eternity,  To perish rather, swallowed up and lost  In the wide womb of uncreated Night,  Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows,  Let this be good, whether our angry Foe  Can give it, or will ever? How he can  Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.  Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,  Belike through impotence or unaware,  To give his enemies their wish, and end  Them in his anger whom his anger saves  To punish endless? Wherefore cease we, then?  Say they who counsel war; we are decreed,  Reserved, and destined to eternal woe;  Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,  What can we suffer worse? Is this, then, worst  Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms?  What when we fled amain, pursued and struck  With Heavens afflicting thunder, and besought  The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed  A refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay  Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse.  What if the breath that kindled those grim fires,  Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage,  
Paradise Lost 
36 of 374 
And plunge us in the flames; or from above  Should intermitted vengeance arm again  His red right hand to plague us? What if all  Her stores were opened, and this firmament  Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire,  Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall  One day upon our heads; while we perhaps,  Designing or exhorting glorious war,  Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled,  Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey  Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk  Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains,  There to converse with everlasting groans,  Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved,  Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse.  War, therefore, open or concealed, alike  My voice dissuades; for what can force or guile  With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye  Views all things at one view? He from Heavens height  All these our motions vain sees and derides,  Not more almighty to resist our might  Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.  Shall we, then, live thus vilethe race of Heaven  Thus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here  Chains and these torments? Better these than worse,  By my advice; since fate inevitable  Subdues us, and omnipotent decree,  The Victors will. To suffer, as to do,  Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust  
Paradise Lost 
37 of 374 
That so ordains. This was at first resolved,  If we were wise, against so great a foe  Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.  I laugh when those who at the spear are bold  And venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear  What yet they know must followto endure  Exile, or igominy, or bonds, or pain,  The sentence of their Conqueror. This is now  Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,  Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit  His anger, and perhaps, thus far removed,  Not mind us not offending, satisfied  With what is punished; whence these raging fires  Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.  Our purer essence then will overcome  Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel;  Or, changed at length, and to the place conformed  In temper and in nature, will receive  Familiar the fierce heat; and, void of pain,  This horror will grow mild, this darkness light;  Besides what hope the never-ending flight  Of future days may bring, what chance, what change  Worth waitingsince our present lot appears  For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,  If we procure not to ourselves more woe.  Thus Belial, with words clothed in reasons garb,  Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth,  Not peace; and after him thus Mammon spake:  Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven  
Paradise Lost 
38 of 374 
We war, if war be best, or to regain  Our own right lost. Him to unthrone we then  May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield  To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife.  The former, vain to hope, argues as vain  The latter; for what place can be for us  Within Heavens bound, unless Heavens Lord supreme  We overpower? Suppose he should relent  And publish grace to all, on promise made  Of new subjection; with what eyes could we  Stand in his presence humble, and receive  Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne  With warbled hyms, and to his Godhead sing  Forced hallelujahs, while he lordly sits  Our envied sovereign, and his altar breathes  Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers,  Our servile offerings? This must be our task  In Heaven, this our delight. How wearisome  Eternity so spent in worship paid  To whom we hate! Let us not then pursue,  By force impossible, by leave obtained  Unacceptable, though in Heaven, our state  Of splendid vassalage; but rather seek  Our own good from ourselves, and from our own  Live to ourselves, though in this vast recess,  Free and to none accountable, preferring  Hard liberty before the easy yoke  Of servile pomp. Our greatness will appear  Then most conspicuous when great things of small,  
Paradise Lost

Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse,  We can create, and in what place soeer  Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain  Through labour and endurance. This deep world  Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst  Thick clouds and dark doth Heavens all-ruling Sire  Choose to reside, his glory unobscured,  And with the majesty of darkness round  Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar.  Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell!  As he our darkness, cannot we his light  Imitate when we please? This desert soil  Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold;  Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise  Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more?  Our torments also may, in length of time,  Become our elements, these piercing fires  As soft as now severe, our temper changed  Into their temper; which must needs remove  The sensible of pain. All things invite  To peaceful counsels, and the settled state  Of order, how in safety best we may  Compose our present evils, with regard  Of what we are and where, dismissing quite  All thoughts of war. Ye have what I advise.  He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled  Th assembly as when hollow rocks retain  The sound of blustering winds, which all night long  Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull

Seafaring men oerwatched, whose bark by chance  Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay  After the tempest. Such applause was heard  As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased,  Advising peace: for such another field  They dreaded worse than Hell; so much the fear  Of thunder and the sword of Michael  Wrought still within them; and no less desire  To found this nether empire, which might rise,  By policy and long process of time,  In emulation opposite to Heaven.  Which when Beelzebub perceivedthan whom,  Satan except, none higher satwith grave  Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed  A pillar of state. Deep on his front engraven  Deliberation sat, and public care;  And princely counsel in his face yet shone,  Majestic, though in ruin. Sage he stood  With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear  The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look  Drew audience and attention still as night  Or summers noontide air, while thus he spake:  Thrones and Imperial Powers, Offspring of Heaven,  Ethereal Virtues! or these titles now  Must we renounce, and, changing style, be called  Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote  Inclineshere to continue, and build up here  A growing empire; doubtless! while we dream,  And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed

This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat  Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt  From Heavens high jurisdiction, in new league  Banded against his throne, but to remain  In strictest bondage, though thus far removed,  Under th inevitable curb, reserved  His captive multitude. For he, to be sure,  In height or depth, still first and last will reign  Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part  By our revolt, but over Hell extend  His empire, and with iron sceptre rule  Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven.  What sit we then projecting peace and war?  War hath determined us and foiled with loss  Irreparable; terms of peace yet none  Vouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given  To us enslaved, but custody severe,  And stripes and arbitrary punishment  Inflicted? and what peace can we return,  But, to our power, hostility and hate,  Untamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow,  Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least  May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice  In doing what we most in suffering feel?  Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need  With dangerous expedition to invade  Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege,  Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find  Some easier enterprise? There is a place  
Paradise Lost

(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven  Err not)another World, the happy seat  Of some new race, called Man, about this time  To be created like to us, though less  In power and excellence, but favoured more  Of him who rules above; so was his will  Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath  That shook Heavens whole circumference confirmed.  Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn  What creatures there inhabit, of what mould  Or substance, how endued, and what their power  And where their weakness: how attempted best,  By force of subtlety. Though Heaven be shut,  And Heavens high Arbitrator sit secure  In his own strength, this place may lie exposed,  The utmost border of his kingdom, left  To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps,  Some advantageous act may be achieved  By sudden onseteither with Hell-fire  To waste his whole creation, or possess  All as our own, and drive, as we were driven,  The puny habitants; or, if not drive,  Seduce them to our party, that their God  May prove their foe, and with repenting hand  Abolish his own works. This would surpass  Common revenge, and interrupt his joy  In our confusion, and our joy upraise  In his disturbance; when his darling sons,  Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse

Their frail original, and faded bliss  Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth  Attempting, or to sit in darkness here  Hatching vain empires. Thus beelzebub  Pleaded his devilish counselfirst devised  By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence,  But from the author of all ill, could spring  So deep a malice, to confound the race  Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell  To mingle and involve, done all to spite  The great Creator? But their spite still serves  His glory to augment. The bold design  Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy  Sparkled in all their eyes: with full assent  They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews:  Well have ye judged, well ended long debate,  Synod of Gods, and, like to what ye are,  Great things resolved, which from the lowest deep  Will once more lift us up, in spite of fate,  Nearer our ancient seatperhaps in view  Of those bright confines, whence, with neighbouring arms,  And opportune excursion, we may chance  Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone  Dwell, not unvisited of Heavens fair light,  Secure, and at the brightening orient beam  Purge off this gloom: the soft delicious air,  To heal the scar of these corrosive fires,  Shall breathe her balm. But, first, whom shall we send  
Paradise Lost 
44 of 374 
In search of this new World? whom shall we find  Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet  The dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss,  And through the palpable obscure find out  His uncouth way, or spread his airy flight,  Upborne with indefatigable wings  Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive  The happy Isle? What strength, what art, can then  Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe,  Through the strict senteries and stations thick  Of Angels watching round? Here he had need  All circumspection: and we now no less  Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send  The weight of all, and our last hope, relies.  This said, he sat; and expectation held  His look suspense, awaiting who appeared  To second, or oppose, or undertake  The perilous attempt. But all sat mute,  Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each  In others countenance read his own dismay,  Astonished. None among the choice and prime  Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found  So hardy as to proffer or accept,  Alone, the dreadful voyage; till, at last,  Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised  Above his fellows, with monarchal pride  Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:  O Progeny of Heaven! Empyreal Thrones!  With reason hath deep silence and demur

Seized us, though undismayed. Long is the way  And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light.  Our prison strong, this huge convex of fire,  Outrageous to devour, immures us round  Ninefold; and gates of burning adamant,  Barred over us, prohibit all egress.  These passed, if any pass, the void profound  Of unessential Night receives him next,  Wide-gaping, and with utter loss of being  Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf.  If thence he scape, into whatever world,  Or unknown region, what remains him less  Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape?  But I should ill become this throne, O Peers,  And this imperial sovereignty, adorned  With splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed  And judged of public moment in the shape  Of difficulty or danger, could deter  Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume  These royalties, and not refuse to reign,  Refusing to accept as great a share  Of hazard as of honour, due alike  To him who reigns, and so much to him due  Of hazard more as he above the rest  High honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers,  Terror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home,  While here shall be our home, what best may ease  The present misery, and render Hell  More tolerable; if there be cure or charm

To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain  Of this ill mansion: intermit no watch  Against a wakeful foe, while I abroad  Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek  Deliverance for us all. This enterprise  None shall partake with me. Thus saying, rose  The Monarch, and prevented all reply;  Prudent lest, from his resolution raised,  Others among the chief might offer now,  Certain to be refused, what erst they feared,  And, so refused, might in opinion stand  His rivals, winning cheap the high repute  Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they  Dreaded not more th adventure than his voice  Forbidding; and at once with him they rose.  Their rising all at once was as the sound  Of thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend  With awful reverence prone, and as a God  Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven.  Nor failed they to express how much they praised  That for the general safety he despised  His own: for neither do the Spirits damned  Lose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast  Their specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,  Or close ambition varnished oer with zeal.  Thus they their doubtful consultations dark  Ended, rejoicing in their matchless Chief:  As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds  Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, oerspread

Heavens cheerful face, the louring element  Scowls oer the darkened landscape snow or shower,  If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet,  Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,  The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds  Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.  O shame to men! Devil with devil damned  Firm concord holds; men only disagree  Of creatures rational, though under hope  Of heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace,  Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife  Among themselves, and levy cruel wars  Wasting the earth, each other to destroy:  As if (which might induce us to accord)  Man had not hellish foes enow besides,  That day and night for his destruction wait!  The Stygian council thus dissolved; and forth  In order came the grand infernal Peers:  Midst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed  Alone th antagonist of Heaven, nor less  Than Hells dread Emperor, with pomp supreme,  And god-like imitated state: him round  A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed  With bright emblazonry, and horrent arms.  Then of their session ended they bid cry  With trumpets regal sound the great result:  Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim  Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy,  By heralds voice explained; the hollow Abyss

Heard far adn wide, and all the host of Hell  With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim.  Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised  By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers  Disband; and, wandering, each his several way  Pursues, as inclination or sad choice  Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find  Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain  The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.  Part on the plain, or in the air sublime,  Upon the wing or in swift race contend,  As at th Olympian games or Pythian fields;  Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal  With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form:  As when, to warn proud cities, war appears  Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush  To battle in the clouds; before each van  Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears,  Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms  From either end of heaven the welkin burns.  Others, with vast Typhoean rage, more fell,  Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air  In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar:  As when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned  With conquest, felt th envenomed robe, and tore  Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines,  And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw  Into th Euboic sea. Others, more mild,  Retreated in a silent valley, sing  
Paradise Lost 
49 of 374 
With notes angelical to many a harp  Their own heroic deeds, and hapless fall  By doom of battle, and complain that Fate  Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance.  Their song was partial; but the harmony  (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)  Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment  The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet  (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense)  Others apart sat on a hill retired,  In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high  Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate  Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,  And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.  Of good and evil much they argued then,  Of happiness and final misery,  Passion and apathy, and glory and shame:  Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!  Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm  Pain for a while or anguish, and excite  Fallacious hope, or arm th obdured breast  With stubborn patience as with triple steel.  Another part, in squadrons and gross bands,  On bold adventure to discover wide  That dismal world, if any clime perhaps  Might yield them easier habitation, bend  Four ways their flying march, along the banks  Of four infernal rivers, that disgorge  Into the burning lake their baleful streams  
Paradise Lost

Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;  Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;  Cocytus, named of lamentation loud  Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton,  Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.  Far off from these, a slow and silent stream,  Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls  Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks  Forthwith his former state and being forgets  Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.  Beyond this flood a frozen continent  Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms  Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land  Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems  Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,  A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog  Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,  Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air  Burns frore, and cold performs th effect of fire.  Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled,  At certain revolutions all the damned  Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change  Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,  From beds of raging fire to starve in ice  Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine  Immovable, infixed, and frozen round  Periods of time,thence hurried back to fire.  They ferry over this Lethean sound  Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment,  
Paradise Lost

And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach  The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose  In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,  All in one moment, and so near the brink;  But Fate withstands, and, to oppose th attempt,  Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards  The ford, and of itself the water flies  All taste of living wight, as once it fled  The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on  In confused march forlorn, th adventurous bands,  With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast,  Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found  No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale  They passed, and many a region dolorous,  Oer many a frozen, many a fiery alp,  Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death  A universe of death, which God by curse  Created evil, for evil only good;  Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,  Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,  Obominable, inutterable, and worse  Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived,  Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire.  Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man,  Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design,  Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell  Explores his solitary flight: sometimes  He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left;

Now shaves with level wing the deep, then soars  Up to the fiery concave towering high.  As when far off at sea a fleet descried  Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds  Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles  Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring  Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flood,  Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape,  Ply stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed  Far off the flying Fiend. At last appear  Hell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof,  And thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass,  Three iron, three of adamantine rock,  Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire,  Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat  On either side a formidable Shape.  The one seemed woman to the waist, and fair,  But ended foul in many a scaly fold,  Voluminous and vasta serpent armed  With mortal sting. About her middle round  A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked  With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung  A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep,  If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,  And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled  Within unseen. Far less abhorred than these  Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts  Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore;  Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called

In secret, riding through the air she comes,  Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance  With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon  Eclipses at their charms. The other Shape  If shape it might be called that shape had none  Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;  Or substance might be called that shadow seemed,  For each seemed eitherblack it stood as Night,  Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,  And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head  The likeness of a kingly crown had on.  Satan was now at hand, and from his seat  The monster moving onward came as fast  With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.  Th undaunted Fiend what this might be admired  Admired, not feared (God and his Son except,  Created thing naught valued he nor shunned),  And with disdainful look thus first began:  Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape,  That darst, though grim and terrible, advance  Thy miscreated front athwart my way  To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass,  That be assured, without leave asked of thee.  Retire; or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,  Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven.  To whom the Goblin, full of wrath, replied:  Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he,  Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith, till then  Unbroken, and in proud rebellious arms

Drew after him the third part of Heavens sons,  Conjured against the Highestfor which both thou  And they, outcast from God, are here condemned  To waste eternal days in woe and pain?  And reckonst thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven  Hell-doomed, and breathst defiance here and scorn,  Where I reign king, and, to enrage thee more,  Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment,  False fugitive; and to thy speed add wings,  Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue  Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart  Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before.  So spake the grisly Terror, and in shape,  So speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold,  More dreadful and deform. On th other side,  Incensed with indignation, Satan stood  Unterrified, and like a comet burned,  That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge  In th arctic sky, and from his horrid hair  Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head  Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands  No second stroke intend; and such a frown  Each cast at th other as when two black clouds,  With heavens artillery fraught, came rattling on  Over the Caspian,then stand front to front  Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow  To join their dark encounter in mid-air.  So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell  Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood;

For never but once more was wither like  To meet so great a foe. And now great deeds  Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung,  Had not the snaky Sorceress, that sat  Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key,  Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.  O father, what intends thy hand, she cried,  Against thy only son? What fury, O son,  Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart  Against thy fathers head? And knowst for whom?  For him who sits above, and laughs the while  At thee, ordained his drudge to execute  Whateer his wrath, which he calls justice, bids  His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!  She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest  Forbore: then these to her Satan returned:  So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange  Thou interposest, that my sudden hand,  Prevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds  What it intends, till first I know of thee  What thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why,  In this infernal vale first met, thou callst  Me father, and that phantasm callst my son.  I know thee not, nor ever saw till now  Sight more detestable than him and thee.  T whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied:  Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I seem  Now in thine eye so foul?once deemed so fair  In Heaven, when at th assembly, and in sight

Of all the Seraphim with thee combined  In bold conspiracy against Heavens King,  All on a sudden miserable pain  Surprised thee, dim thine eyes and dizzy swum  In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast  Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide,  Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright,  Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed,  Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized  All th host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid  At first, and called me Sin, and for a sign  Portentous held me; but, familiar grown,  I pleased, and with attractive graces won  The most aversethee chiefly, who, full oft  Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing,  Becamst enamoured; and such joy thou tookst  With me in secret that my womb conceived  A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose,  And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained  (For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe  Clear victory; to our part loss and rout  Through all the Empyrean. Down they fell,  Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down  Into this Deep; and in the general fall  I also: at which time this powerful key  Into my hands was given, with charge to keep  These gates for ever shut, which none can pass  Without my opening. Pensive here I sat  Alone; but long I sat not, till my womb,

Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown,  Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.  At last this odious offspring whom thou seest,  Thine own begotten, breaking violent way,  Tore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain  Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew  Transformed: but he my inbred enemy  Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart,  Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death!  Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed  From all her caves, and back resounded Death!  I fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems,  Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far,  Me overtook, his mother, all dismayed,  And, in embraces forcible and foul  Engendering with me, of that rape begot  These yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry  Surround me, as thou sawsthourly conceived  And hourly born, with sorrow infinite  To me; for, when they list, into the womb  That bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw  My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth  Afresh, with conscious terrors vex me round,  That rest or intermission none I find.  Before mine eyes in opposition sits  Grim Death, my son and foe, who set them on,  And me, his parent, would full soon devour  For want of other prey, but that he knows  His end with mine involved, and knows that I

Should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane,  Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced.  But thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun  His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope  To be invulnerable in those bright arms,  Through tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint,  Save he who reigns above, none can resist.  She finished; and the subtle Fiend his lore  Soon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth:  Dear daughtersince thou claimst me for thy sire,  And my fair son here showst me, the dear pledge  Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys  Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change  Befallen us unforeseen, unthought-ofknow,  I come no enemy, but to set free  From out this dark and dismal house of pain  Both him and thee, and all the heavenly host  Of Spirits that, in our just pretences armed,  Fell with us from on high. From them I go  This uncouth errand sole, and one for all  Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread  Th unfounded Deep, and through the void immense  To search, with wandering quest, a place foretold  Should beand, by concurring signs, ere now  Created vast and rounda place of bliss  In the purlieus of Heaven; and therein placed  A race of upstart creatures, to supply  Perhaps our vacant room, though more removed,  Lest Heaven, surcharged with potent multitude,

Might hap to move new broils. Be this, or aught  Than this more secret, now designed, I haste  To know; and, this once known, shall soon return,  And bring ye to the place where thou and Death  Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen  Wing silently the buxom air, embalmed  With odours. There ye shall be fed and filled  Immeasurably; all things shall be your prey.  He ceased; for both seemed highly pleased, and Death  Grinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear  His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw  Destined to that good hour. No less rejoiced  His mother bad, and thus bespake her sire:  The key of this infernal Pit, by due  And by command of Heavens all-powerful King,  I keep, by him forbidden to unlock  These adamantine gates; against all force  Death ready stands to interpose his dart,  Fearless to be oermatched by living might.  But what owe I to his commands above,  Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down  Into this gloom of Tartarus profound,  To sit in hateful office here confined,  Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born  Here in perpetual agony and pain,  With terrors and with clamours compassed round  Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed?  Thou art my father, thou my author, thou  My being gavst me; whom should I obey

But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon  To that new world of light and bliss, among  The gods who live at ease, where I shall reign  At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems  Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.  Thus saying, from her side the fatal key,  Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;  And, towards the gate rolling her bestial train,  Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew,  Which, but herself, not all the Stygian Powers  Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns  Th intricate wards, and every bolt and bar  Of massy iron or solid rock with ease  Unfastens. On a sudden open fly,  With impetuous recoil and jarring sound,  Th infernal doors, and on their hinges grate  Harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook  Of Erebus. She opened; but to shut  Excelled her power: the gates wide open stood,  That with extended wings a bannered host,  Under spread ensigns marching, mibht pass through  With horse and chariots ranked in loose array;  So wide they stood, and like a furnace-mouth  Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.  Before their eyes in sudden view appear  The secrets of the hoary Deepa dark  Illimitable ocean, without bound,  Without dimension; where length, breadth, and height,  And time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night

And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold  Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise  Of endless wars, and by confusion stand.  For Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce,  Strive here for mastery, and to battle bring  Their embryon atoms: they around the flag  Of each his faction, in their several clans,  Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow,  Swarm populous, unnumbered as the sands  Of Barca or Cyrenes torrid soil,  Levied to side with warring winds, and poise  Their lighter wings. To whom these most adhere  He rules a moment: Chaos umpire sits,  And by decision more embroils the fray  By which he reigns: next him, high arbiter,  Chance governs all. Into this wild Abyss,  The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave,  Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire,  But all these in their pregnant causes mixed  Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight,  Unless th Almighty Maker them ordain  His dark materials to create more worlds  Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend  Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,  Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith  He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed  With noises loud and ruinous (to compare  Great things with small) than when Bellona storms  With all her battering engines, bent to rase

Some capital city; or less than if this frame  Of Heaven were falling, and these elements  In mutiny had from her axle torn  The steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans  He spread for flight, and, in the surging smoke  Uplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league,  As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides  Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets  A vast vacuity. All unawares,  Fluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops  Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour  Down had been falling, had not, by ill chance,  The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud,  Instinct with fire and nitre, hurried him  As many miles aloft. That fury stayed  Quenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea,  Nor good dry landnigh foundered, on he fares,  Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,  Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail.  As when a gryphon through the wilderness  With winged course, oer hill or moory dale,  Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth  Had from his wakeful custody purloined  The guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend  Oer bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,  With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,  And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.  At length a universal hubbub wild  Of stunning sounds, and voices all confused,

Borne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear  With loudest vehemence. Thither he plies  Undaunted, to meet there whatever Power  Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss  Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask  Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies  Bordering on light; when straight behold the throne  Of Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread  Wide on the wasteful Deep! With him enthroned  Sat sable-vested Night, eldest of things,  The consort of his reign; and by them stood  Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name  Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance,  And Tumult, and Confusion, all embroiled,  And Discord with a thousand various mouths.  T whom Satan, turning boldly, thus:Ye Powers  And Spirtis of this nethermost Abyss,  Chaos and ancient Night, I come no spy  With purpose to explore or to disturb  The secrets of your realm; but, by constraint  Wandering this darksome desert, as my way  Lies through your spacious empire up to light,  Alone and without guide, half lost, I seek,  What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds  Confine with Heaven; or, if some other place,  From your dominion won, th Ethereal King  Possesses lately, thither to arrive  I travel this profound. Direct my course:  Directed, no mean recompense it brings

To your behoof, if I that region lost,  All usurpation thence expelled, reduce  To her original darkness and your sway  (Which is my present journey), and once more  Erect the standard there of ancient Night.  Yours be th advantage all, mine the revenge!  Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old,  With faltering speech and visage incomposed,  Answered: I know thee, stranger, who thou art ***  That mighty leading Angel, who of late  Made head against Heavens King, though overthrown.  I saw and heard; for such a numerous host  Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep,  With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,  Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates  Poured out by millions her victorious bands,  Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here  Keep residence; if all I can will serve  That little which is left so to defend,  Encroached on still through our intestine broils  Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell,  Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath;  Now lately Heaven and Earth, another world  Hung oer my realm, linked in a golden chain  To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell!  If that way be your walk, you have not far;  So much the nearer danger. Go, and speed;  Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain.  He ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply,

But, glad that now his sea should find a shore,  With fresh alacrity and force renewed  Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire,  Into the wild expanse, and through the shock  Of fighting elements, on all sides round  Environed, wins his way; harder beset  And more endangered than when Argo passed  Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks,  Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned  Charybdis, and by th other whirlpool steered.  So he with difficulty and labour hard  Moved on, with difficulty and labour he;  But, he once passed, soon after, when Man fell,  Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain,  Following his track (such was the will of Heaven)  Paved after him a broad and beaten way  Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf  Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length,  From Hell continued, reaching th utmost orb  Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse  With easy intercourse pass to and fro  To tempt or punish mortals, except whom  God and good Angels guard by special grace.  But now at last the sacred influence  Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven  Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night  A glimmering dawn. Here Nature first begins  Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire,  As from her outmost works, a broken foe,

With tumult less and with less hostile din;  That Satan with less toil, and now with ease,  Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light,  And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds  Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn;  Or in the emptier waste, resembling air,  Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold  Far off th empyreal Heaven, extended wide  In circuit, undetermined square or round,  With opal towers and battlements adorned  Of living sapphire, once his native seat;  And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain,  This pendent World, in bigness as a star  Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.  Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge,  Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies.

Hail, holy Light, offspring of Heaven firstborn,  Or of the Eternal coeternal beam  May I express thee unblamd? since God is light,  And never but in unapproached light  Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee  Bright effluence of bright essence increate.  Or hear"st thou rather pure ethereal stream,  Whose fountain who shall tell? before the sun,  Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice  Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest ***  The rising world of waters dark and deep,  Won from the void and formless infinite.  Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,  Escapd the Stygian pool, though long detaind  In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight  Through utter and through middle darkness borne,  With other notes than to the Orphean lyre  I sung of Chaos and eternal Night;  Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down  The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,  Though hard and rare: Thee I revisit safe,  And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou  Revisitst not these eyes, that roll in vain  To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;  So thick a drop serene hath quenchd their orbs,  Or dim suffusion veild. Yet not the more

Cease I to wander, where the Muses haunt,  Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,  Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief  Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,  That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,  Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget  So were I equalld with them in renown,  Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;  Blind Thamyris, and blind Maeonides,  And Tiresias, and Phineus, prophets old:  Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move  Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird  Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid  Tunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year  Seasons return; but not to me returns  Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,  Or sight of vernal bloom, or summers rose,  Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;  But cloud instead, and ever-during dark  Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men  Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair  Presented with a universal blank  Of natures works to me expungd and rasd,  And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.  So much the rather thou, celestial Light,  Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers  Irradiate; there plant eyes, all mist from thence  Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell  Of things invisible to mortal sight.

Now had the Almighty Father from above,  From the pure empyrean where he sits  High thrond above all highth, bent down his eye  His own works and their works at once to view:  About him all the Sanctities of Heaven  Stood thick as stars, and from his sight receivd  Beatitude past utterance; on his right  The radiant image of his glory sat,  His only son; on earth he first beheld  Our two first parents, yet the only two  Of mankind in the happy garden placd  Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,  Uninterrupted joy, unrivalld love,  In blissful solitude; he then surveyd  Hell and the gulf between, and Satan there  Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night  In the dun air sublime, and ready now  To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet,  On the bare outside of this world, that seemd  Firm land imbosomd, without firmament,  Uncertain which, in ocean or in air.  Him God beholding from his prospect high,  Wherein past, present, future, he beholds,  Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake.

On desperate revenge, that shall redound  Upon his own rebellious head. And now,  Through all restraint broke loose, he wings his way  Not far off Heaven, in the precincts of light,  Directly towards the new created world,  And man there placd, with purpose to assay  If him by force he can destroy, or, worse,  By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert;  For man will hearken to his glozing lies,  And easily transgress the sole command,  Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall  He and his faithless progeny: Whose fault?  Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of me  All he could have; I made him just and right,  Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.  Such I created all the ethereal Powers  And Spirits, both them who stood, and them who faild;  Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.  Not free, what proof could they have given sincere  Of true allegiance, constant faith or love,  Where only what they needs must do appeard,  Not what they would? what praise could they receive?  What pleasure I from such obedience paid,  When will and reason (reason also is choice)  Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild,  Made passive both, had servd necessity,  Not me? they therefore, as to right belong$ d,  So were created, nor can justly accuse  Their Maker, or their making, or their fate,

As if predestination over-ruld  Their will disposd by absolute decree  Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed  Their own revolt, not I; if I foreknew,  Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,  Which had no less proved certain unforeknown.  So without least impulse or shadow of fate,  Or aught by me immutably foreseen,  They trespass, authors to themselves in all  Both what they judge, and what they choose; for so  I formd them free: and free they must remain,  Till they enthrall themselves; I else must change  Their nature, and revoke the high decree  Unchangeable, eternal, which ordaind  $THeir freedom: they themselves ordaind their fall.  The first sort by their own suggestion fell,  Self-tempted, self-depravd: Man falls, deceivd  By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,  The other none: In mercy and justice both,  Through Heaven and Earth, so shall my glory excel;  But Mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine.  Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance filld  All Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect  Sense of new joy ineffable diffusd.  Beyond compare the Son of God was seen  Most glorious; in him all his Father shone  Substantially expressd; and in his face  Divine compassion visibly appeard,  Love without end, and without measure grace,

Which uttering, thus he to his Father spake.  O Father, gracious was that word which closd  Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace;  , that Man should find grace;  For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol  Thy praises, with the innumerable sound  Of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne  Encompassd shall resound thee ever blest.  For should Man finally be lost, should Man,  Thy creature late so lovd, thy youngest son,  Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joind  With his own folly? that be from thee far,  That far be from thee, Father, who art judge  Of all things made, and judgest only right.  Or shall the Adversary thus obtain  His end, and frustrate thine? shall he fulfill  His malice, and thy goodness bring to nought,  Or proud return, though to his heavier doom,  Yet with revenge accomplishd, and to Hell  Draw after him the whole race of mankind,  By him corrupted? or wilt thou thyself  Abolish thy creation, and unmake  For him, what for thy glory thou hast made?  So should thy goodness and thy greatness both  Be questiond and blasphemd without defence.  To whom the great Creator thus replied.  O son, in whom my soul hath chief delight,  Son of my bosom, Son who art alone.  My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,  
Paradise Lost 
73 of 374 
All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all  As my eternal purpose hath decreed;  Man shall not quite be lost, but savd who will;  Yet not of will in him, but grace in me  Freely vouchsafd; once more I will renew  His lapsed powers, though forfeit; and enthralld  By sin to foul exorbitant desires;  Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand  On even ground against his mortal foe;  By me upheld, that he may know how frail  His fallen condition is, and to me owe  All his deliverance, and to none but me.  Some I have chosen of peculiar grace,  Elect above the rest; so is my will:  The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd  Their sinful state, and to appease betimes  The incensed Deity, while offerd grace  Invites; for I will clear their senses dark,  What may suffice, and soften stony hearts  To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.  To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,  Though but endeavourd with sincere intent,  Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.  And I will place within them as a guide,  My umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear,  Light after light, well usd, they shall attain,  And to the end, persisting, safe arrive.  This my long sufferance, and my day of grace,  They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;  
Paradise Lost

But hard be hardend, blind be blinded more,  That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;  And none but such from mercy I exclude.  But yet all is not done; Man disobeying,  Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins  Against the high supremacy of Heaven,  Affecting God-head, and, so losing all,  To expiate his treason hath nought left,  But to destruction sacred and devote,  He, with his whole posterity, must die,  Die he or justice must; unless for him  Some other able, and as willing, pay  The rigid satisfaction, death for death.  Say, heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love?  Which of you will be mortal, to redeem  Mans mortal crime, and just the unjust to save?  Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?  And silence was in Heaven: $ on Mans behalf  He askd, but all the heavenly quire stood mute,  Patron or intercessour none appeard,  Much less that durst upon his own head draw  The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.  And now without redemption all mankind  Must have been lost, adjudgd to Death and Hell  By doom severe, had not the Son of God,  In whom the fulness dwells of love divine,  His dearest mediation thus renewd.  Father, thy word is past, Man shall find grace;  And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,  
Paradise Lost

The speediest of thy winged messengers,  To visit all thy creatures, and to all  Comes unprevented, unimplord, unsought?  Happy for Man, so coming; he her aid  Can never seek, once dead in sins, and lost;  Atonement for himself, or offering meet,  Indebted and undone, hath none to bring;  Behold me then: me for him, life for life  I offer: on me let thine anger fall;  Account me Man; I for his sake will leave  Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee  Freely put off, and for him lastly die  Well pleased; on me let Death wreak all his rage.  Under his gloomy power I shall not long  Lie vanquished. Thou hast given me to possess  Life in myself for ever; by thee I live;  Though now to Death I yield, and am his due,  All that of me can die, yet, that debt paid,  $ thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave  His prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul  For ever with corruption there to dwell;  But I shall rise victorious, and subdue  My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil.  Death his deaths wound shall then receive, and stoop  Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed;  I through the ample air in triumph high  Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell, and show  The powers of darkness bound. Thou, at the sight  Pleased, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,  
Paradise Lost

While, by thee raised, I ruin all my foes;  Death last, and with his carcase glut the grave;  Then, with the multitude of my redeemed,  Shall enter Heaven, long absent, and return,  Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud  Of anger shall remain, but peace assured  And reconcilement: wrath shall be no more  Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire.  His words here ended; but his meek aspect  Silent yet spake, and breathed immortal love  To mortal men, above which only shone  Filial obedience: as a sacrifice  Glad to be offered, he attends the will  Of his great Father. Admiration seized  All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend,  Wondering; but soon th Almighty thus replied.  O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace  Found out for mankind under wrath, O thou  My sole complacence! Well thou knowst how dear  To me are all my works; nor Man the least,  Though last created, that for him I spare  Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,  By losing thee a while, the whole race lost.   
00021053  Thou, therefore, whom thou only canst redeem,  Their nature also to thy nature join;  And be thyself Man among men on Earth,  Made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed,

By wondrous birth; be thou in Adams room  The head of all mankind, though Adams son.  As in him perish all men, so in thee,  As from a second root, shall be restored  As many as are restored, without thee none.  His crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit,  Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce  Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,  And live in thee transplanted, and from thee  Receive new life. So Man, as is most just,  Shall satisfy for Man, be judged and die,  And dying rise, and rising with him raise  His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life.  So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate,  Giving to death, and dying to redeem,  So dearly to redeem what hellish hate  So easily destroyed, and still destroys  In those who, when they may, accept not grace.  Nor shalt thou, by descending to assume  Mans nature, lessen or degrade thine own.  Because thou hast, though throned in highest bliss  Equal to God, and equally enjoying  God-like fruition, quitted all, to save  A world from utter loss, and hast been found  By merit more than birthright Son of God,  Found worthiest to be so by being good,  Far more than great or high; because in thee  Love hath abounded more than glory abounds;  Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt

With thee thy manhood also to this throne:  Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign  Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,  Anointed universal King; all power  I give thee; reign for ever, and assume  Thy merits; under thee, as head supreme,  Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce:  All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide  In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell.  When thou, attended gloriously from Heaven,  Shalt in the sky appear, and from thee send  The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaim  Thy dread tribunal; forthwith from all winds,  The living, and forthwith the cited dead  Of all past ages, to the general doom  Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep.  Then, all thy saints assembled, thou shalt judge  Bad Men and Angels; they, arraigned, shall sink  Beneath thy sentence; Hell, her numbers full,  Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while  The world shall burn, and from her ashes spring  New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell,  And, after all their tribulations long,  See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,  With joy and peace triumphing, and fair truth.  Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by,  For regal scepter then no more shall need,  God shall be all in all. But, all ye Gods,  Adore him, who to compass all this dies;

Adore the Son, and honour him as me.  No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all  The multitude of Angels, with a shout  Loud as from numbers without number, sweet  As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung  With jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled  The eternal regions: Lowly reverent  Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground  With solemn adoration down they cast  Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold;  Immortal amarant, a flower which once  In Paradise, fast by the tree of life,  Began to bloom; but soon for mans offence  To Heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows,  And flowers aloft shading the fount of life,  And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven  Rolls oer Elysian flowers her amber stream;  With these that never fade the Spirits elect  Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams;  Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright  Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone,  Impurpled with celestial roses smiled.  Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took,  Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side  Like quivers hung, and with preamble sweet  Of charming symphony they introduce  Their sacred song, and waken raptures high;  No voice exempt, no voice but well could join  Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.

Thee, Father, first they sung Omnipotent,  Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,  Eternal King; the Author of all being,  Fonntain of light, thyself invisible  Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitst  Throned inaccessible, but when thou shadest  The full blaze of thy beams, and, through a cloud  Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine,  Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,  Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim  Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.  Thee next they sang of all creation first,  Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,  In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud  Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,  Whom else no creature can behold; on thee  Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides,  Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.  He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein  By thee created; and by thee threw down  The aspiring Dominations: Thou that day  Thy Fathers dreadful thunder didst not spare,  Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels, that shook  Heavens everlasting frame, while oer the necks  Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed.  Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim  Thee only extolled, Son of thy Fathers might,  To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,  Not so on Man: Him through their malice fallen,

Father of mercy and grace, thou didst not doom  So strictly, but much more to pity incline:  No sooner did thy dear and only Son  Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man  So strictly, but much more to pity inclined,  He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife  Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned,  Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat  Second to thee, offered himself to die  For Mans offence. O unexampled love,  Love no where to be found less than Divine!  Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men! Thy name  Shall be the copious matter of my song  Henceforth, and never shall my heart thy praise  Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoin.  Thus they in Heaven, above the starry sphere,  Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.  Mean while upon the firm opacous globe  Of this round world, whose first convex divides  The luminous inferiour orbs, enclosed  From Chaos, and the inroad of Darkness old,  Satan alighted walks: A globe far off  It seemed, now seems a boundless continent  Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night  Starless exposed, and ever-threatening storms  Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky;  Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven,  Though distant far, some small reflection gains  Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud:

Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.  As when a vultur on Imaus bred,  Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,  Dislodging from a region scarce of prey  To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids,  On hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs  Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams;  But in his way lights on the barren plains  Of Sericana, where Chineses drive  With sails and wind their cany waggons light:  So, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend  Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey;  Alone, for other creature in this place,  Living or lifeless, to be found was none;  None yet, but store hereafter from the earth  Up hither like aereal vapours flew  Of all things transitory and vain, when sin  With vanity had filled the works of men:  Both all things vain, and all who in vain things  Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame,  Or happiness in this or the other life;  All who have their reward on earth, the fruits  Of painful superstition and blind zeal,  Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find  Fit retribution, empty as their deeds;  All the unaccomplished works of Natures hand,  Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,  Dissolved on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,  Till final dissolution, wander here;

Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed;  Those argent fields more likely habitants,  Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold  Betwixt the angelical and human kind.  Hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born  First from the ancient world those giants came  With many a vain exploit, though then renowned:  The builders next of Babel on the plain  Of Sennaar, and still with vain design,  New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:  Others came single; he, who, to be deemed  A God, leaped fondly into Aetna flames,  Empedocles; and he, who, to enjoy  Platos Elysium, leaped into the sea,  Cleombrotus; and many more too long,  Embryos, and idiots, eremites, and friars  White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery.  Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek  In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven;  And they, who to be sure of Paradise,  Dying, put on the weeds of Dominick,  Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised;  They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,  And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs  The trepidation talked, and that first moved;  And now Saint Peter at Heavens wicket seems  To wait them with his keys, and now at foot  Of Heavens ascent they lift their feet, when lo  A violent cross wind from either coast

Blows them transverse, ten thousand leagues awry  Into the devious air: Then might ye see  Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost  And fluttered into rags; then reliques, beads,  Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls,  The sport of winds: All these, upwhirled aloft,  Fly oer the backside of the world far off  Into a Limbo large and broad, since called  The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown  Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod.  All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed,  And long he wandered, till at last a gleam  Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste  His travelled steps: far distant he descries  Ascending by degrees magnificent  Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high;  At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared  The work as of a kingly palace-gate,  With frontispiece of diamond and gold  Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems  The portal shone, inimitable on earth  By model, or by shading pencil, drawn.  These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw  Angels ascending and descending, bands  Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled  To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz  Dreaming by night under the open sky  And waking cried, This is the gate of Heaven.  Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood  
Paradise Lost 
85 of 374 
There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes  Viewless; and underneath a bright sea flowed  Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon  Who after came from earth, failing arrived  Wafted by Angels, or flew oer the lake  Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds.  The stairs were then let down, whether to dare  The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate  His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss:  Direct against which opened from beneath,  Just oer the blissful seat of Paradise,  A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide,  Wider by far than that of after-times  Over mount Sion, and, though that were large,  Over the Promised Land to God so dear;  By which, to visit oft those happy tribes,  On high behests his angels to and fro  Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard  From Paneas, the fount of Jordans flood,  To Beersaba, where the Holy Land  Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore;  So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set  To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave.  Satan from hence, now on the lower stair,  That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate,  Looks down with wonder at the sudden view  Of all this world at once. As when a scout,  Through dark?;nd desart ways with?oeril gone  All?might,?;t?kast by break of cheerful dawn

Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill,  Which to his eye discovers unaware  The goodly prospect of some foreign land  First seen, or some renowned metropolis  With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned,  Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams:  Such wonder seised, though after Heaven seen,  The Spirit malign, but much more envy seised,  At sight of all this world beheld so fair.  Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood  So high above the circling canopy  Of nights extended shade,) from eastern point  Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears  Andromeda far off Atlantick seas  Beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole  He views in breadth, and without longer pause  Down right into the worlds first region throws  His flight precipitant, and winds with ease  Through the pure marble air his oblique way  Amongst innumerable stars, that shone  Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds;  Or other worlds they seemed, or happy isles,  Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old,  Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales,  Thrice happy isles; but who dwelt happy there  He staid not to inquire: Above them all  The golden sun, in splendour likest Heaven,  Allured his eye; thither his course he bends  Through the calm firmament, (but up or down,

By center, or eccentrick, hard to tell,  Or longitude,) where the great luminary  Aloof the vulgar constellations thick,  That from his lordly eye keep distance due,  Dispenses light from far; they, as they move  Their starry dance in numbers that compute  Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp  Turn swift their various motions, or are turned  By his magnetick beam, that gently warms  The universe, and to each inward part  With gentle penetration, though unseen,  Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep;  So wonderously was set his station bright.  There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps  Astronomer in the suns lucent orb  Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw.  The place he found beyond expression bright,  Compared with aught on earth, metal or stone;  Not all parts like, but all alike informed  With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire;  If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear;  If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite,  Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone  In Aarons breast-plate, and a stone besides  Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen,  That stone, or like to that which here below  Philosophers in vain so long have sought,  In vain, though by their powerful art they bind  Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound

In various shapes old Proteus from the sea,  Drained through a limbeck to his native form.  What wonder then if fields and regions here  Breathe forth Elixir pure, and rivers run  Potable gold, when with one virtuous touch  The arch-chemick sun, so far from us remote,  Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed,  Here in the dark so many precious things  Of colour glorious, and effect so rare?  Here matter new to gaze the Devil met  Undazzled; far and wide his eye commands;  For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,  But all sun-shine, as when his beams at noon  Culminate from the equator, as they now  Shot upward still direct, whence no way round  Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air,  No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray  To objects distant far, whereby he soon  Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,  The same whom John saw also in the sun:  His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;  Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar  Circled his head, nor less his locks behind  Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings  Lay waving round; on some great charge employed  He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.  Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope  To find who might direct his wandering flight  To Paradise, the happy seat of Man,

His journeys end and our beginning woe.  But first he casts to change his proper shape,  Which else might work him danger or delay:  And now a stripling Cherub he appears,  Not of the prime, yet such as in his face  Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb  Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned:  Under a coronet his flowing hair  In curls on either cheek played; wings he wore  Of many a coloured plume, sprinkled with gold;  His habit fit for speed succinct, and held  Before his decent steps a silver wand.  He drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright,  Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned,  Admonished by his ear, and straight was known  The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven  Who in Gods presence, nearest to his throne,  Stand ready at command, and are his eyes  That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth  Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,  Oer sea and land: him Satan thus accosts.  Uriel, for thou of those seven Spirits that stand  In sight of Gods high throne, gloriously bright,  The first art wont his great authentick will  Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring,  Where all his sons thy embassy attend;  And here art likeliest by supreme decree  Like honour to obtain, and as his eye  To visit oft this new creation round;

Unspeakable desire to see, and know  All these his wonderous works, but chiefly Man,  His chief delight and favour, him for whom  All these his works so wonderous he ordained,  Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim  Alone thus wandering. Brightest Seraph, tell  In which of all these shining orbs hath Man  His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,  But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell;  That I may find him, and with secret gaze  Or open admiration him behold,  On whom the great Creator hath bestowed  Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured;  That both in him and all things, as is meet,  The universal Maker we may praise;  Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes  To deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss,  Created this new happy race of Men  To serve him better: Wise are all his ways.  So spake the false dissembler unperceived;  For neither Man nor Angel can discern  Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks  Invisible, except to God alone,  By his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth:  And oft, though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps  At wisdoms gate, and to simplicity  Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill  Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguiled  Uriel, though regent of the sun, and held

The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven;  Who to the fraudulent impostor foul,  In his uprightness, answer thus returned.  Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know  The works of God, thereby to glorify  The great Work-master, leads to no excess  That reaches blame, but rather merits praise  The more it seems excess, that led thee hither  From thy empyreal mansion thus alone,  To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps,  Contented with report, hear only in Heaven:  For wonderful indeed are all his works,  Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all  Had in remembrance always with delight;  But what created mind can comprehend  Their number, or the wisdom infinite  That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep?  I saw when at his word the formless mass,  This worlds material mould, came to a heap:  Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar  Stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined;  Till at his second bidding Darkness fled,  Light shone, and order from disorder sprung:  Swift to their several quarters hasted then  The cumbrous elements, earth, flood, air, fire;  And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven  Flew upward, spirited with various forms,  That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars  Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;

Each had his place appointed, each his course;  The rest in circuit walls this universe.  Look downward on that globe, whose hither side  With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;  That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light  His day, which else, as the other hemisphere,  Night would invade; but there the neighbouring moon  So call that opposite fair star) her aid  Timely interposes, and her monthly round  Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven,  With borrowed light her countenance triform  Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth,  And in her pale dominion checks the night.  That spot, to which I point, is Paradise,  Adams abode; those lofty shades, his bower.  Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.  Thus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low,  As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven,  Where honour due and reverence none neglects,  Took leave, and toward the coast of earth beneath,  Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped success,  Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel;  Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.

Book IV 
O, for that warning voice, which he, who saw  The Apocalypse, heard cry in Heaven aloud,  Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,  Came furious down to be revenged on men,  Woe to the inhabitants on earth! that now,  While time was, our first parents had been warned  The coming of their secret foe, and scaped,  Haply so scaped his mortal snare: For now  Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down,  The tempter ere the accuser of mankind,  To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss  Of that first battle, and his flight to Hell:  Yet, not rejoicing in his speed, though bold  Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,  Begins his dire attempt; which nigh the birth  Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast,  And like a devilish engine back recoils  Upon himself; horrour and doubt distract  His troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stir  The Hell within him; for within him Hell  He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell  One step, no more than from himself, can fly  By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair,  That slumbered; wakes the bitter memory  Of what he was, what is, and what must be  Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.  
Paradise Lost 
94 of 374 
Sometimes towards Eden, which now in his view  Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad;  Sometimes towards Heaven, and the full-blazing sun,  Which now sat high in his meridian tower:  Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began.  O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned,  Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God  Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars  Hide their diminished heads; to thee I call,  But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,  Of Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams,  That bring to my remembrance from what state  I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere;  Till pride and worse ambition threw me down  Warring in Heaven against Heavens matchless King:  Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return  From me, whom he created what I was  In that bright eminence, and with his good  Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.  What could be less than to afford him praise,  The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,  How due! yet all his good proved ill in me,  And wrought but malice; lifted up so high  I sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher  Would set me highest, and in a moment quit  The debt immense of endless gratitude,  So burdensome still paying, still to owe,  Forgetful what from him I still received,  And understood not that a grateful mind  
Paradise Lost 
95 of 374 
By owing owes not, but still pays, at once  Indebted and discharged; what burden then  O, had his powerful destiny ordained  Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood  Then happy; no unbounded hope had raised  Ambition! Yet why not some other Power  As great might have aspired, and me, though mean,  Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great  Fell not, but stand unshaken, from within  Or from without, to all temptations armed.  Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?  Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,  But Heavens free love dealt equally to all?  Be then his love accursed, since love or hate,  To me alike, it deals eternal woe.  Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will  Chose freely what it now so justly rues.  Me miserable! which way shall I fly  Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?  Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell;  And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep  Still threatening to devour me opens wide,  To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.  O, then, at last relent: Is there no place  Left for repentance, none for pardon left?  None left but by submission; and that word  Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame  Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced  With other promises and other vaunts  
Paradise Lost 
96 of 374 
Than to submit, boasting I could subdue  The Omnipotent. Ay me! they little know  How dearly I abide that boast so vain,  Under what torments inwardly I groan,  While they adore me on the throne of Hell.  With diadem and scepter high advanced,  The lower still I fall, only supreme  In misery: Such joy ambition finds.  But say I could repent, and could obtain,  By act of grace, my former state; how soon  Would highth recall high thoughts, how soon unsay  What feigned submission swore? Ease would recant  Vows made in pain, as violent and void.  For never can true reconcilement grow,  Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep:  Which would but lead me to a worse relapse  And heavier fall: so should I purchase dear  Short intermission bought with double smart.  This knows my Punisher; therefore as far  From granting he, as I from begging, peace;  All hope excluded thus, behold, in stead  Mankind created, and for him this world.  So farewell, hope; and with hope farewell, fear;  Farewell, remorse! all good to me is lost;  Evil, be thou my good; by thee at least  Divided empire with Heavens King I hold,  By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign;  As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know.  Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face  
Paradise Lost 
97 of 374 
Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy, and despair;  Which marred his borrowed visage, and betrayed  Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld.  For heavenly minds from such distempers foul  Are ever clear. Whereof he soon aware,  Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm,  Artificer of fraud; and was the first  That practised falsehood under saintly show,  Deep malice to conceal, couched with revenge:  Yet not enough had practised to deceive  Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down  The way he went, and on the Assyrian mount  Saw him disfigured, more than could befall  Spirit of happy sort; his gestures fierce  He marked and mad demeanour, then alone,  As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen.  So on he fares, and to the border comes  Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,  Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green,  As with a rural mound, the champaign head  Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides  Access denied; and overhead upgrew  Insuperable height of loftiest shade,  Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,  A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend,  Shade above shade, a woody theatre  Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops  The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung;   
Paradise Lost 
98 of 374 
00081429  Which to our general sire gave prospect large  Into his nether empire neighbouring round.  And higher than that wall a circling row  Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit,  Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,  Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed:  On which the sun more glad impressed his beams  Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow,  When God hath showered the earth; so lovely seemed  That landskip: And of pure now purer air  Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires  Vernal delight and joy, able to drive  All sadness but despair: Now gentle gales,  Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense  Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole  Those balmy spoils. As when to them who fail  Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past  Mozambick, off at sea north-east winds blow  Sabean odours from the spicy shore  Of Araby the blest; with such delay  Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league  Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles:  So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend,  Who came their bane; though with them better pleased  Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume  That drove him, though enamoured, from the spouse  Of Tobits son, and with a vengeance sent  From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound.  
Paradise Lost

Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill  Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow;  But further way found none, so thick entwined,  As one continued brake, the undergrowth  Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed  All path of man or beast that passed that way.  One gate there only was, and that looked east  On the other side: which when the arch-felon saw,  Due entrance he disdained; and, in contempt,  At one flight bound high over-leaped all bound  Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within  Lights on his feet. As when a prowling wolf,  Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,  Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve  In hurdled cotes amid the field secure,  Leaps oer the fence with ease into the fold:  Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash  Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors,  Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault,  In at the window climbs, or oer the tiles:  So clomb this first grand thief into Gods fold;  So since into his church lewd hirelings climb.  Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life,  The middle tree and highest there that grew,  Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life  Thereby regained, but sat devising death  To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought  Of that life-giving plant, but only used  For prospect, what well used had been the pledge  
Paradise Lost 
100 of 374 
Of immortality. So little knows  Any, but God alone, to value right  The good before him, but perverts best things  To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.  Beneath him with new wonder now he views,  To all delight of human sense exposed,  In narrow room, Natures whole wealth, yea more,  A Heaven on Earth: For blissful Paradise  Of God the garden was, by him in the east  Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line  From Auran eastward to the royal towers  Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings,  Of where the sons of Eden long before  Dwelt in Telassar: In this pleasant soil  His far more pleasant garden God ordained;  Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow  All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;  And all amid them stood the tree of life,  High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit  Of vegetable gold; and next to life,  Our death, the tree of knowledge, grew fast by,  Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill.  Southward through Eden went a river large,  Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill  Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown  That mountain as his garden-mould high raised  Upon the rapid current, which, through veins  Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn,  Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill

Watered the garden; thence united fell  Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood,  Which from his darksome passage now appears,  And now, divided into four main streams,  Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm  And country, whereof here needs no account;  But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,  How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks,  Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold,  With mazy errour under pendant shades  Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed  Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art  In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon  Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,  Both where the morning sun first warmly smote  The open field, and where the unpierced shade  Imbrowned the noontide bowers: Thus was this place  A happy rural seat of various view;  Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm,  Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,  Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true,  If true, here only, and of delicious taste:  Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks  Grazing the tender herb, were interposed,  Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap  Of some irriguous valley spread her store,  Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose:  Another side, umbrageous grots and caves  Of cool recess, oer which the mantling vine

Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps  Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall  Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a lake,  That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned  Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams.  The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs,  Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune  The trembling leaves, while universal Pan,  Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,  Led on the eternal Spring. Not that fair field  Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers,  Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis  Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain  To seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove  Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired  Castalian spring, might with this Paradise  Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle  Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham,  Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove,  Hid Amalthea, and her florid son  Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rheas eye;  Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard,  Mount Amara, though this by some supposed  True Paradise under the Ethiop line  By Nilus head, enclosed with shining rock,  A whole days journey high, but wide remote  From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend  Saw, undelighted, all delight, all kind  Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange

Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall,  Godlike erect, with native honour clad  In naked majesty seemed lords of all:  And worthy seemed; for in their looks divine  The image of their glorious Maker shone,  Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure,  (Severe, but in true filial freedom placed,)  Whence true authority in men; though both  Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed;  For contemplation he and valour formed;  For softness she and sweet attractive grace;  He for God only, she for God in him:  His fair large front and eye sublime declared  Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks  Round from his parted forelock manly hung  Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad:  She, as a veil, down to the slender waist  Her unadorned golden tresses wore  Dishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved  As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied  Subjection, but required with gentle sway,  And by her yielded, by him best received,  Yielded with coy submission, modest pride,  And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.  Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed;  Then was not guilty shame, dishonest shame  Of natures works, honour dishonourable,  Sin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind  With shows instead, mere shows of seeming pure,

And banished from mans life his happiest life,  Simplicity and spotless innocence!  So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight  Of God or Angel; for they thought no ill:  So hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair,  That ever since in loves embraces met;  Adam the goodliest man of men since born  His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve.  Under a tuft of shade that on a green  Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side  They sat them down; and, after no more toil  Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed  To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease  More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite  More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell,  Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs  Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline  On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers:  The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind,  Still as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream;  Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles  Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems  Fair couple, linked in happy nuptial league,  Alone as they. About them frisking played  All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase  In wood or wilderness, forest or den;  Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw  Dandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards,  Gambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant,

To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed  His?kithetmroboscis; close the serpent sly,  Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine  His braided train, and of his fatal guile  Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass  Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat,  Or bedward ruminating; for the sun,  Declined, was hasting now with prone career  To the ocean isles, and in the ascending scale  Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose:  When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood,  Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad.  O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold!  Into our room of bliss thus high advanced  Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,  Not Spirits, yet to heavenly Spirits bright  Little inferiour; whom my thoughts pursue  With wonder, and could love, so lively shines  In them divine resemblance, and such grace  The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured.  Ah! gentle pair, ye little think how nigh  Your change approaches, when all these delights  Will vanish, and deliver ye to woe;  More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;  Happy, but for so happy ill secured  Long to continue, and this high seat your Heaven  Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe  As now is entered; yet no purposed foe  To you, whom I could pity thus forlorn,

Though I unpitied: League with you I seek,  And mutual amity, so strait, so close,  That I with you must dwell, or you with me  Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please,  Like this fair Paradise, your sense; yet such  Accept your Makers work; he gave it me,  Which I as freely give: Hell shall unfold,  To entertain you two, her widest gates,  And send forth all her kings; there will be room,  Not like these narrow limits, to receive  Your numerous offspring; if no better place,  Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge  On you who wrong me not for him who wronged.  And should I at your harmless innocence  Melt, as I do, yet publick reason just,  Honour and empire with revenge enlarged,  By conquering this new world, compels me now  To do what else, though damned, I should abhor.  So spake the Fiend, and with necessity,  The tyrants plea, excused his devilish deeds.  Then from his lofty stand on that high tree  Down he alights among the sportful herd  Of those four-footed kinds, himself now one,  Now other, as their shape served best his end  Nearer to view his prey, and, unespied,  To mark what of their state he more might learn,  By word or action marked. About them round  A lion now he stalks with fiery glare;  Then as a tiger, who by chance hath spied

In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play,  Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft  His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground,  Whence rushing, he might surest seize them both,  Griped in each paw: when, Adam first of men  To first of women Eve thus moving speech,  Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow.  Sole partner, and sole part, of all these joys,  Dearer thyself than all; needs must the Power  That made us, and for us this ample world,  Be infinitely good, and of his good  As liberal and free as infinite;  That raised us from the dust, and placed us here  In all this happiness, who at his hand  Have nothing merited, nor can perform  Aught whereof he hath need; he who requires  From us no other service than to keep  This one, this easy charge, of all the trees  In Paradise that bear delicious fruit  So various, not to taste that only tree  Of knowledge, planted by the tree of life;  So near grows death to life, whateer death is,  Some dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowest  God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree,  The only sign of our obedience left,  Among so many signs of power and rule  Conferred upon us, and dominion given  Over all other creatures that possess  Earth, air, and sea. Then let us not think hard

One easy prohibition, who enjoy  Free leave so large to all things else, and choice  Unlimited of manifold delights:  But let us ever praise him, and extol  His bounty, following our delightful task,  To prune these growing plants, and tend these flowers,  Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet.  To whom thus Eve replied. O thou for whom  And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh,  And without whom am to no end, my guide  And head! what thou hast said is just and right.  For we to him indeed all praises owe,  And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy  So far the happier lot, enjoying thee  Pre-eminent by so much odds, while thou  Like consort to thyself canst no where find.  That day I oft remember, when from sleep  I first awaked, and found myself reposed  Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where  And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.  Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound  Of waters issued from a cave, and spread  Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved  Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went  With unexperienced thought, and laid me down  On the green bank, to look into the clear  Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky.  As I bent down to look, just opposite  A shape within the watery gleam appeared,

Bending to look on me: I started back,  It started back; but pleased I soon returned,  Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks  Of sympathy and love: There I had fixed  Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire,  Had not a voice thus warned me; What thou seest,  What there thou seest, fair Creature, is thyself;  With thee it came and goes: but follow me,  And I will bring thee where no shadow stays  Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, he  Whose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy  Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear  Multitudes like thyself, and thence be called  Mother of human race. What could I do,  But follow straight, invisibly thus led?  Till I espied thee, fair indeed and tall,  Under a platane; yet methought less fair,  Less winning soft, less amiably mild,  Than that smooth watery image: Back I turned;  Thou following cryedst aloud, Return, fair Eve;  Whom flyest thou? whom thou flyest, of him thou art,  His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent  Out of my side to thee, nearest my heart,  Substantial life, to have thee by my side  Henceforth an individual solace dear;  Part of my soul I seek thee, and thee claim  My other half: With that thy gentle hand  Seised mine: I yielded;and from that time see  How beauty is excelled by manly grace,

And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.  So spake our general mother, and with eyes  Of conjugal attraction unreproved,  And meek surrender, half-embracing leaned  On our first father; half her swelling breast  Naked met his, under the flowing gold  Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight  Both of her beauty, and submissive charms,  Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter  On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds  That shed Mayflowers; and pressed her matron lip  With kisses pure: Aside the Devil turned  For envy; yet with jealous leer malign  Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained.  Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two,  Imparadised in one anothers arms,  The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill  Of bliss on bliss; while I to Hell am thrust,  Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,  Among our other torments not the least,  Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines.  Yet let me not forget what I have gained  From their own mouths: All is not theirs, it seems;  One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called,  Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidden  Suspicious, reasonless. Why should their Lord  Envy them that? Can it be sin to know?  Can it be death? And do they only stand  By ignorance? Is that their happy state,

The proof of their obedience and their faith?  O fair foundation laid whereon to build  Their ruin! hence I will excite their minds  With more desire to know, and to reject  Envious commands, invented with design  To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt  Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such,  They taste and die: What likelier can ensue  But first with narrow search I must walk round  This garden, and no corner leave unspied;  A chance but chance may lead where I may meet  Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side,  Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw  What further would be learned. Live while ye may,  Yet happy pair; enjoy, till I return,  Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed!  So saying, his proud step he scornful turned,  But with sly circumspection, and began  Through wood, through waste, oer hill, oer dale, his roam  Mean while in utmost longitude, where Heaven  With earth and ocean meets, the setting sun  Slowly descended, and with right aspect  Against the eastern gate of Paradise  Levelled his evening rays: It was a rock  Of alabaster, piled up to the clouds,  Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent  Accessible from earth, one entrance high;  The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung

Still as it rose, impossible to climb.  Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat,  Chief of the angelick guards, awaiting night;  About him exercised heroick games  The unarmed youth of Heaven, but nigh at hand  Celestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears,  Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold.  Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even  On a sun-beam, swift as a shooting star  In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired  Impress the air, and shows the mariner  From what point of his compass to beware  Impetuous winds: He thus began in haste.  Gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath given  Charge and strict watch, that to this happy place  No evil thing approach or enter in.  This day at highth of noon came to my sphere  A Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know  More of the Almightys works, and chiefly Man,  Gods latest image: I described his way  Bent all on speed, and marked his aery gait;  But in the mount that lies from Eden north,  Where he first lighted, soon discerned his looks  Alien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured:  Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade  Lost sight of him: One of the banished crew,  I fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raise  New troubles; him thy care must be to find.  To whom the winged warriour thus returned.

Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight,  Amid the suns bright circle where thou sitst,  See far and wide: In at this gate none pass  The vigilance here placed, but such as come  Well known from Heaven; and since meridian hour  No creature thence: If Spirit of other sort,  So minded, have oer-leaped these earthly bounds  On purpose, hard thou knowest it to exclude  Spiritual substance with corporeal bar.  But if within the circuit of these walks,  In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom  Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know.  So promised he; and Uriel to his charge  Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised  Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen  Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb,  Incredible how swift, had thither rolled  Diurnal, or this less volubil earth,  By shorter flight to the east, had left him there  Arraying with reflected purple and gold  The clouds that on his western throne attend.  Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray  Had in her sober livery all things clad;  Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,  They to their grassy couch, these to their nests  Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;  She all night long her amorous descant sung;  Silence was pleased: Now glowed the firmament  With living sapphires: Hesperus, that led

The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,  Rising in clouded majesty, at length  Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light,  And oer the dark her silver mantle threw.  When Adam thus to Eve. Fair Consort, the hour  Of night, and all things now retired to rest,  Mind us of like repose; since God hath set  Labour and rest, as day and night, to men  Successive; and the timely dew of sleep,  Now falling with soft slumbrous weight, inclines  Our eye-lids: Other creatures all day long  Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest;  Man hath his daily work of body or mind  Appointed, which declares his dignity,  And the regard of Heaven on all his ways;  While other animals unactive range,  And of their doings God takes no account.  To-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east  With first approach of light, we must be risen,  And at our pleasant labour, to reform  Yon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green,  Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown,  That mock our scant manuring, and require  More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth:  Those blossoms also, and those dropping gums,  That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth,  Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;  Mean while, as Nature wills, night bids us rest.  To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorned

My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst  Unargued I obey: So God ordains;  God is thy law, thou mine: To know no more  Is womans happiest knowledge, and her praise.  With thee conversing I forget all time;  All seasons, and their change, all please alike.  Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet,  With charm of earliest birds: pleasant the sun,  When first on this delightful land he spreads  His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,  Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth  After soft showers; and sweet the coming on  Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night,  With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,  And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train:  But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends  With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun  On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower,  Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers;  Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night,  With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon,  Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.  But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom  This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?  To whom our general ancestor replied.  Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve,  These have their course to finish round the earth,  By morrow evening, and from land to land  In order, though to nations yet unborn,  
Paradise Lost

Ministring light prepared, they set and rise;  Lest total Darkness should by night regain  Her old possession, and extinguish life  In Nature and all things; which these soft fires  Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat  Of various influence foment and warm,  Temper or nourish, or in part shed down  Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow  On earth, made hereby apter to receive  Perfection from the suns more potent ray.  These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,  Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none,  That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise:  Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth  Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:  All these with ceaseless praise his works behold  Both day and night: How often from the steep  Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard  Celestial voices to the midnight air,  Sole, or responsive each to others note,  Singing their great Creator? oft in bands  While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk,  With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds  In full harmonick number joined, their songs  Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.  Thus talking, hand in hand alone they passed  On to their blissful bower: it was a place  Chosen by the sovran Planter, when he framed  All things to Mans delightful use; the roof  
Paradise Lost 
117 of 374 
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade  Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew  Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side  Acanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub,  Fenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flower,  Iris all hues, roses, and jessamin,  Reared high their flourished heads between, and wrought  Mosaick; underfoot the violet,  Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay  Broidered the ground, more coloured than with stone  Of costliest emblem: Other creature here,  Bird, beast, insect, or worm, durst enter none,  Such was their awe of Man. In shadier bower  More sacred and sequestered, though but feigned,  Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph  Nor Faunus haunted. Here, in close recess,  With flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs,  Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed;  And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung,  What day the genial Angel to our sire  Brought her in naked beauty more adorned,  More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods  Endowed with all their gifts, and O! too like  In sad event, when to the unwiser son  Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnared  Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged  On him who had stole Joves authentick fire.  Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood,  Both turned, and under open sky adored  
Paradise Lost 
118 of 374 
The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven,  Which they beheld, the moons resplendent globe,  And starry pole: Thou also madest the night,  Maker Omnipotent, and thou the day,  Which we, in our appointed work employed,  Have finished, happy in our mutual help  And mutual love, the crown of all our bliss  Ordained by thee; and this delicious place  For us too large, where thy abundance wants  Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.  But thou hast promised from us two a race  To fill the earth, who shall with us extol  Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,  And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.  This said unanimous, and other rites  Observing none, but adoration pure  Which God likes best, into their inmost bower  Handed they went; and, eased the putting off  These troublesome disguises which we wear,  Straight side by side were laid; nor turned, I ween,  Adam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the rites  Mysterious of connubial love refused:  Whatever hypocrites austerely talk  Of purity, and place, and innocence,  Defaming as impure what God declares  Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all.  Our Maker bids encrease; who bids abstain  But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?  Hail, wedded Love, mysterious law, true source

Of human offspring, sole propriety  In Paradise of all things common else!  By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men  Among the bestial herds to range; by thee  Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure,  Relations dear, and all the charities  Of father, son, and brother, first were known.  Far be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,  Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,  Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets,  Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced,  Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used.  Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights  His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings,  Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile  Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared,  Casual fruition; nor in court-amours,  Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball,  Or serenate, which the starved lover sings  To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.  These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept,  And on their naked limbs the flowery roof  Showered roses, which the morn repaired. Sleep on,  Blest pair; and O!yet happiest, if ye seek  No happier state, and know to know no more.  Now had night measured with her shadowy cone  Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault,  And from their ivory port the Cherubim,  Forth issuing at the accustomed hour, stood armed

To their night watches in warlike parade;  When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.  Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south  With strictest watch; these other wheel the north;  Our circuit meets full west. As flame they part,  Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear.  From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called  That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.  Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged speed  Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nook;  But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge,  Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm.  This evening from the suns decline arrived,  Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen  Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped  The bars of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:  Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.  So saying, on he led his radiant files,  Dazzling the moon; these to the bower direct  In search of whom they sought: Him there they found  Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve,  Assaying by his devilish art to reach  The organs of her fancy, and with them forge  Illusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams;  Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint  The animal spirits, that from pure blood arise  Like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise  At least distempered, discontented thoughts,  Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires,  
Paradise Lost

Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride.  Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear  Touched lightly; for no falshood can endure  Touch of celestial temper, but returns  Of force to its own likeness: Up he starts  Discovered and surprised. As when a spark  Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid  Fit for the tun some magazine to store  Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain,  With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air;  So started up in his own shape the Fiend.  Back stept those two fair Angels, half amazed  So sudden to behold the grisly king;  Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon.  Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell  Comest thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed,  Why satst thou like an enemy in wait,  Here watching at the head of these that sleep?  Know ye not then said Satan, filled with scorn,  Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate  For you, there sitting where ye durst not soar:  Not to know me argues yourselves unknown,  The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know,  Why ask ye, and superfluous begin  Your message, like to end as much in vain?  To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn.  Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,  Or undiminished brightness to be known,  As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure;  
Paradise Lost 
122 of 374 
That glory then, when thou no more wast good,  Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now  Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul.  But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account  To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep  This place inviolable, and these from harm.  So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke,  Severe in youthful beauty, added grace  Invincible: Abashed the Devil stood,  And felt how awful goodness is, and saw  Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined  His loss; but chiefly to find here observed  His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed  Undaunted. If I must contend, said he,  Best with the best, the sender, not the sent,  Or all at once; more glory will be won,  Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold,  Will save us trial what the least can do  Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.  The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage;  But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on,  Champing his iron curb: To strive or fly  He held it vain; awe from above had quelled  His heart, not else dismayed. Now drew they nigh  The western point, where those half-rounding guards  Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined,  A waiting next command. To whom their Chief,  Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud.  O friends! I hear the tread of nimble feet  
Paradise Lost 
123 of 374 
Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern  Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade;  And with them comes a third of regal port,  But faded splendour wan; who by his gait  And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,  Not likely to part hence without contest;  Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.  He scarce had ended, when those two approached,  And brief related whom they brought, where found,  How busied, in what form and posture couched.  To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.  Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed  To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge  Of others, who approve not to transgress  By thy example, but have power and right  To question thy bold entrance on this place;  Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those  Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss!  To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow.  Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise,  And such I held thee; but this question asked  Puts me in doubt. Lives there who loves his pain!  Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,  Though thither doomed! Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt  And boldly venture to whatever place  Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change  Torment with ease, and soonest recompense  Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;  To thee no reason, who knowest only good,  
Paradise Lost 
124 of 374 
But evil hast not tried: and wilt object  His will who bounds us! Let him surer bar  His iron gates, if he intends our stay  In that dark durance: Thus much what was asked.  The rest is true, they found me where they say;  But that implies not violence or harm.  Thus he in scorn. The warlike Angel moved,  Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied.  O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise  Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew,  And now returns him from his prison scaped,  Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise  Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither  Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed;  So wise he judges it to fly from pain  However, and to scape his punishment!  So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath,  Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight  Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,  Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain  Can equal anger infinite provoked.  But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee  Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they  Less hardy to endure? Courageous Chief!  The first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleged  To thy deserted host this cause of flight,  Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.  To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern.  Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,  
Paradise Lost

Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood  Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid  The blasting vollied thunder made all speed,  And seconded thy else not dreaded spear.  But still thy words at random, as before,  Argue thy inexperience what behoves  From hard assays and ill successes past  A faithful leader, not to hazard all  Through ways of danger by himself untried:  I, therefore, I alone first undertook  To wing the desolate abyss, and spy  This new created world, whereof in Hell  Fame is not silent, here in hope to find  Better abode, and my afflicted Powers  To settle here on earth, or in mid air;  Though for possession put to try once more  What thou and thy gay legions dare against;  Whose easier business were to serve their Lord  High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne,  And practised distances to cringe, not fight,  To whom the warriour Angel soon replied.  To say and straight unsay, pretending first  Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy,  Argues no leader but a liear traced,  Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name,  O sacred name of faithfulness profaned!  Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?  Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head.  Was this your discipline and faith engaged,  
Paradise Lost 
126 of 374 
Your military obedience, to dissolve  Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?  And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem  Patron of liberty, who more than thou  Once fawned, and cringed, and servily adored  Heavens awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope  To dispossess him, and thyself to reign?  But mark what I arreed thee now, Avant;  Fly neither whence thou fledst! If from this hour  Within these hallowed limits thou appear,  Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained,  And seal thee so, as henceforth not to scorn  The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred.  So threatened he; but Satan to no threats  Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied.  Then when I am thy captive talk of chains,  Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then  Far heavier load thyself expect to feel  From my prevailing arm, though Heavens King  Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers,  Usd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels  In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved.  While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright  Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns  Their phalanx, and began to hem him round  With ported spears, as thick as when a field  Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends  Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind  Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands,  
Paradise Lost

Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves  Prove chaff. On the other side, Satan, alarmed,  Collecting all his might, dilated stood,  Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved:  His stature reached the sky, and on his crest  Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp  What seemed both spear and shield: Now dreadful deeds  Might have ensued, nor only Paradise  In this commotion, but the starry cope  Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements  At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn  With violence of this conflict, had not soon  The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,  Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen  Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign,  Wherein all things created first he weighed,  The pendulous round earth with balanced air  In counterpoise, now ponders all events,  Battles and realms: In these he put two weights,  The sequel each of parting and of fight:  The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam,  Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend.  Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine;  Neither our own, but given: What folly then  To boast what arms can do? since thine no more  Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now  To trample thee as mire: For proof look up,  And read thy lot in yon celestial sign;  Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how

weak,  If thou resist. The Fiend looked up, and knew  His mounted scale aloft: Nor more;but fled  Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.

Book V 
Now Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime  Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl,  When Adam waked, so customed; for his sleep  Was aery-light, from pure digestion bred,  And temperate vapours bland, which the only sound  Of leaves and fuming rills, Auroras fan,  Lightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song  Of birds on every bough; so much the more  His wonder was to find unwakened Eve  With tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek,  As through unquiet rest: He, on his side  Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love  Hung over her enamoured, and beheld  Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep,  Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice  Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,  Her hand soft touching, whispered thus. Awake,  My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,  Heavens last best gift, my ever new delight!  Awake: The morning shines, and the fresh field  Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring  Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove,  What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,  How nature paints her colours, how the bee  Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.  Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye  
Paradise Lost 
130 of 374 
On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.  O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,  My glory, my perfection! glad I see  Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night  (Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,  If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,  Works of day past, or morrows next design,  But of offence and trouble, which my mind  Knew never till this irksome night: Methought,  Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk  With gentle voice; I thought it thine: It said,  Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,  The cool, the silent, save where silence yields  To the night-warbling bird, that now awake  Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns  Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light  Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain,  If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes,  Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire?  In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment  Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.  I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;  To find thee I directed then my walk;  And on, methought, alone I passed through ways  That brought me on a sudden to the tree  Of interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed,  Much fairer to my fancy than by day:  And, as I wondering looked, beside it stood  One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven  
Paradise Lost 
131 of 374 
By us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled  Ambrosia; on that tree he also gazed;  And O fair plant, said he, with fruit surcharged,  Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,  Nor God, nor Man? Is knowledge so despised?  Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?  Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold  Longer thy offered good; why else set here?  This said, he paused not, but with venturous arm  He plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled  At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold:  But he thus, overjoyed; O fruit divine,  Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,  Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit  For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:  And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more  Communicated, more abundant grows,  The author not impaired, but honoured more?  Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!  Partake thou also; happy though thou art,  Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be:  Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods  Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined,  But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes  Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see  What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!  So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,  Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part  Which he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell  
Paradise Lost 
132 of 374 
So quickened appetite, that I, methought,  Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the clouds  With him I flew, and underneath beheld  The earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide  And various: Wondering at my flight and change  To this high exaltation; suddenly  My guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,  And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked  To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her night  Related, and thus Adam answered sad.  Best image of myself, and dearer half,  The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep  Affects me equally; nor can I like  This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;  Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,  Created pure. But know that in the soul  Are many lesser faculties, that serve  Reason as chief; among these Fancy next  Her office holds; of all external things  Which the five watchful senses represent,  She forms imaginations, aery shapes,  Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames  All what we affirm or what deny, and call  Our knowledge or opinion; then retires  Into her private cell, when nature rests.  Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes  To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,  Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams;  Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.  
Paradise Lost 
133 of 374 
Some such resemblances, methinks, I find  Of our last evenings talk, in this thy dream,  But with addition strange; yet be not sad.  Evil into the mind of God or Man  May come and go, so unreproved, and leave  No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope  That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,  Waking thou never will consent to do.  Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks,  That wont to be more cheerful and serene,  Than when fair morning first smiles on the world;  And let us to our fresh employments rise  Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers  That open now their choisest bosomed smells,  Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store.  So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered;  But silently a gentle tear let fall  From either eye, and wiped them with her hair;  Two other precious drops that ready stood,  Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell  Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse  And pious awe, that feared to have offended.  So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.  But first, from under shady arborous roof  Soon as they forth were come to open sight  Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,  With wheels yet hovering oer the ocean-brim,  Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,  Discovering in wide landskip all the east

Of Paradise and Edens happy plains,  Lowly they bowed adoring, and began  Their orisons, each morning duly paid  In various style; for neither various style  Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise  Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung  Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence  Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,  More tuneable than needed lute or harp  To add more sweetness; and they thus began.  These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,  Almighty! Thine this universal frame,  Thus wonderous fair; Thyself how wonderous then!  Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens  To us invisible, or dimly seen  In these thy lowest works; yet these declare  Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.  Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,  Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs  And choral symphonies, day without night,  Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven  On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol  Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.  Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,  If better thou belong not to the dawn,  Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn  With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,  While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.  Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,  
Paradise Lost 
135 of 374 
Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise  In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,  And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.  Moon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,  With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;  And ye five other wandering Fires, that move  In mystick dance not without song, resound  His praise, who out of darkness called up light.  Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth  Of Natures womb, that in quaternion run  Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix  And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change  Vary to our great Maker still new praise.  Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise  From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,  Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,  In honour to the worlds great Author rise;  Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,  Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,  Rising or falling still advance his praise.  His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,  Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines,  With every plant, in sign of worship wave.  Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,  Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.  Join voices, all ye living Souls: Ye Birds,  That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend,  Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.  Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk

The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;  Witness if I be silent, morn or even,  To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,  Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.  Hail, universal Lord, be bounteous still  To give us only good; and if the night  Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed,  Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark!  So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts  Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.  On to their mornings rural work they haste,  Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row  Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far  Their pampered boughs, and needed hands to check  Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine  To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines  Her marriageable arms, and with him brings  Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn  His barren leaves. Them thus employed beheld  With pity Heavens high King, and to him called  Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned  To travel with Tobias, and secured  His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.  Raphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth  Satan, from Hell scaped through the darksome gulf,  Hath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed  This night the human pair; how he designs  In them at once to ruin all mankind.  Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend  
Paradise Lost 
137 of 374 
Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade  Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired,  To respite his day-labour with repast,  Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,  As may advise him of his happy state,  Happiness in his power left free to will,  Left to his own free will, his will though free,  Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware  He swerve not, too secure: Tell him withal  His danger, and from whom; what enemy,  Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now  The fall of others from like state of bliss;  By violence? no, for that shall be withstood;  But by deceit and lies: This let him know,  Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend  Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.  So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled  All justice: Nor delayed the winged Saint  After his charge received; but from among  Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood  Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,  Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires,  On each hand parting, to his speed gave way  Through all the empyreal road; till, at the gate  Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide  On golden hinges turning, as by work  Divine the sovran Architect had framed.  From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,  Star interposed, however small he sees,  
Paradise Lost

Not unconformed to other shining globes,  Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned  Above all hills. As when by night the glass  Of Galileo, less assured, observes  Imagined lands and regions in the moon:  Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades  Delos or Samos first appearing, kens  A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight  He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky  Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing  Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan  Winnows the buxom air; till, within soar  Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems  A phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird,  When, to enshrine his reliques in the Suns  Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.  At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise  He lights, and to his proper shape returns  A Seraph winged: Six wings he wore, to shade  His lineaments divine; the pair that clad  Each shoulder broad, came mantling oer his breast  With regal ornament; the middle pair  Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round  Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold  And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet  Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail,  Sky-tinctured grain. Like Maias son he stood,  And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled  The circuit wide. Straight knew him all the bands  
Paradise Lost

Of Angels under watch; and to his state,  And to his message high, in honour rise;  For on some message high they guessed him bound.  Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come  Into the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,  And flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;  A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here  Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will  Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet,  Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss.  Him through the spicy forest onward come  Adam discerned, as in the door he sat  Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun  Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm  Earths inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs:  And Eve within, due at her hour prepared  For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please  True appetite, and not disrelish thirst  Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,  Berry or grape: To whom thus Adam called.  Haste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold  Eastward among those trees, what glorious shape  Comes this way moving; seems another morn  Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven  To us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe  This day to be our guest. But go with speed,  And, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour  Abundance, fit to honour and receive  Our heavenly stranger: Well we may afford  
Paradise Lost

Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow  From large bestowed, where Nature multiplies  Her fertile growth, and by disburthening grows  More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.  To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowed mould,  Of God inspired! small store will serve, where store,  All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;  Save what by frugal storing firmness gains  To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:  But I will haste, and from each bough and brake,  Each plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice  To entertain our Angel-guest, as he  Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth  God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.  So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste  She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent  What choice to choose for delicacy best,  What order, so contrived as not to mix  Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring  Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change;  Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk  Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields  In India East or West, or middle shore  In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where  Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat  Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell,  She gathers, tribute large, and on the board  Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape  She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths  
Paradise Lost 
141 of 374 
From many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed  She tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold  Wants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground  With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.  Mean while our primitive great sire, to meet  His God-like guest, walks forth, without more train  Accompanied than with his own complete  Perfections; in himself was all his state,  More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits  On princes, when their rich retinue long  Of horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold,  Dazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.  Nearer his presence Adam, though not awed,  Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,  As to a superiour nature bowing low,  Thus said. Native of Heaven, for other place  None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain;  Since, by descending from the thrones above,  Those happy places thou hast deigned a while  To want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us  Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess  This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower  To rest; and what the garden choicest bears  To sit and taste, till this meridian heat  Be over, and the sun more cool decline.  Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.  Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such  Created, or such place hast here to dwell,  As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,  
Paradise Lost 
142 of 374 
To visit thee; lead on then where thy bower  Oershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,  I have at will. So to the sylvan lodge  They came, that like Pomonas arbour smiled,  With flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve,  Undecked save with herself, more lovely fair  Than Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned  Of three that in mount Ida naked strove,  Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil  She needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm  Altered her cheek. On whom the Angel Hail  Bestowed, the holy salutation used  Long after to blest Mary, second Eve.  Hail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb  Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,  Than with these various fruits the trees of God  Have heaped this table!Raised of grassy turf  Their table was, and mossy seats had round,  And on her ample square from side to side  All autumn piled, though spring and autumn here  Danced hand in hand. A while discourse they hold;  No fear lest dinner cool; when thus began  Our author. Heavenly stranger, please to taste  These bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom  All perfect good, unmeasured out, descends,  To us for food and for delight hath caused  The earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps  To spiritual natures; only this I know,  That one celestial Father gives to all.  
Paradise Lost 
143 of 374 
To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives  (Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part  Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found  No ingrateful food: And food alike those pure  Intelligential substances require,  As doth your rational; and both contain  Within them every lower faculty  Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,  Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,  And corporeal to incorporeal turn.  For know, whatever was created, needs  To be sustained and fed: Of elements  The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,  Earth and the sea feed air, the air those fires  Ethereal, and as lowest first the moon;  Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged  Vapours not yet into her substance turned.  Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale  From her moist continent to higher orbs.  The sun that light imparts to all, receives  From all his alimental recompence  In humid exhalations, and at even  Sups with the ocean. Though in Heaven the trees  Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines  Yield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn  We brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground  Covered with pearly grain: Yet God hath here  Varied his bounty so with new delights,  As may compare with Heaven; and to taste  
Paradise Lost 
144 of 374 
Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat,  And to their viands fell; nor seemingly  The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss  Of Theologians; but with keen dispatch  Of real hunger, and concoctive heat  To transubstantiate: What redounds, transpires  Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire  Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist  Can turn, or holds it possible to turn,  Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,  As from the mine. Mean while at table Eve  Ministered naked, and their flowing cups  With pleasant liquours crowned: O innocence  Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,  Then had the sons of God excuse to have been  Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts  Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy  Was understood, the injured lovers hell.  Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,  Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose  In Adam, not to let the occasion pass  Given him by this great conference to know  Of things above his world, and of their being  Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw  Transcend his own so far; whose radiant forms,  Divine effulgence, whose high power, so far  Exceeded human; and his wary speech  Thus to the empyreal minister he framed.  Inhabitant with God, now know I well  
Paradise Lost 
145 of 374 
Thy favour, in this honour done to Man;  Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed  To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,  Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,  As that more willingly thou couldst not seem  At Heavens high feasts to have fed: yet what compare  To whom the winged Hierarch replied.  O Adam, One Almighty is, from whom  All things proceed, and up to him return,  If not depraved from good, created all  Such to perfection, one first matter all,  Endued with various forms, various degrees  Of substance, and, in things that live, of life;  But more refined, more spiritous, and pure,  As nearer to him placed, or nearer tending  Each in their several active spheres assigned,  Till body up to spirit work, in bounds  Proportioned to each kind. So from the root  Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves  More aery, last the bright consummate flower  Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,  Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,  To vital spirits aspire, to animal,  To intellectual; give both life and sense,  Fancy and understanding; whence the soul  Reason receives, and reason is her being,  Discursive, or intuitive; discourse  Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,  Differing but in degree, of kind the same.  
Paradise Lost 
146 of 374 
Wonder not then, what God for you saw good  If I refuse not, but convert, as you  To proper substance. Time may come, when Men  With Angels may participate, and find  No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;  And from these corporal nutriments perhaps  Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit,  Improved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend  Ethereal, as we; or may, at choice,  Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell;  If ye be found obedient, and retain  Unalterably firm his love entire,  Whose progeny you are. Mean while enjoy  Your fill what happiness this happy state  Can comprehend, incapable of more.  To whom the patriarch of mankind replied.  O favourable Spirit, propitious guest,  Well hast thou taught the way that might direct  Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set  From center to circumference; whereon,  In contemplation of created things,  By steps we may ascend to God. But say,  What meant that caution joined, If ye be found  Obedient? Can we want obedience then  To him, or possibly his love desert,  Who formed us from the dust and placed us here  Full to the utmost measure of what bliss  Human desires can seek or apprehend?  To whom the Angel. Son of Heaven and Earth,  
Paradise Lost 
147 of 374 
Attend! That thou art happy, owe to God;  That thou continuest such, owe to thyself,  That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.  This was that caution given thee; be advised.  God made thee perfect, not immutable;  And good he made thee, but to persevere  He left it in thy power; ordained thy will  By nature free, not over-ruled by fate  Inextricable, or strict necessity:  Our voluntary service he requires,  Not our necessitated; such with him  Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how  Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve  Willing or no, who will but what they must  By destiny, and can no other choose?  Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand  In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state  Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;  On other surety none: Freely we serve,  Because we freely love, as in our will  To love or not; in this we stand or fall:  And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,  And so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall  From what high state of bliss, into what woe!  To whom our great progenitor. Thy words  Attentive, and with more delighted ear,  Divine instructer, I have heard, than when  Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills  Aereal musick send: Nor knew I not  
Paradise Lost 
148 of 374 
To be both will and deed created free;  Yet that we never shall forget to love  Our Maker, and obey him whose command  Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts  Assured me, and still assure: Though what thou tellest  Hath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move,  But more desire to hear, if thou consent,  The full relation, which must needs be strange,  Worthy of sacred silence to be heard;  And we have yet large day, for scarce the sun  Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins  His other half in the great zone of Heaven.  Thus Adam made request; and Raphael,  After short pause assenting, thus began.  High matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men,  Sad task and hard: For how shall I relate  To human sense the invisible exploits  Of warring Spirits? how, without remorse,  The ruin of so many glorious once  And perfect while they stood? how last unfold  The secrets of another world, perhaps  Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good  This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach  Of human sense, I shall delineate so,  By likening spiritual to corporal forms,  As may express them best; though what if Earth  Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein  Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?  As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild

Reigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests  Upon her center poised; when on a day  (For time, though in eternity, applied  To motion, measures all things durable  By present, past, and future,) on such day  As Heavens great year brings forth, the empyreal host  Of Angels by imperial summons called,  Innumerable before the Almightys throne  Forthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared  Under their Hierarchs in orders bright:  Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,  Standards and gonfalons twixt van and rear  Stream in the air, and for distinction serve  Of hierarchies, of orders, and degrees;  Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed  Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love  Recorded eminent. Thus when in orbs  Of circuit inexpressible they stood,  Orb within orb, the Father Infinite,  By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,  Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top  Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.  Hear, all ye Angels, progeny of light,  Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;  Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.  This day I have begot whom I declare  My only Son, and on this holy hill  Him have anointed, whom ye now behold

At my right hand; your head I him appoint;  And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow  All knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord:  Under his great vice-gerent reign abide  United, as one individual soul,  For ever happy: Him who disobeys,  Me disobeys, breaks union, and that day,  Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls  Into utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place  Ordained without redemption, without end.  So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words  All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.  That day, as other solemn days, they spent  In song and dance about the sacred hill;  Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere  Of planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels  Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,  Eccentrick, intervolved, yet regular  Then most, when most irregular they seem;  And in their motions harmony divine  So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear  Listens delighted. Evening now approached,  (For we have also our evening and our morn,  We ours for change delectable, not need;)  Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn  Desirous; all in circles as they stood,  Tables are set, and on a sudden piled  With Angels food, and rubied nectar flows  In pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,

Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.  On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,  They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet  Quaff immortality and joy, secure  Of surfeit, where full measure only bounds  Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered  With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.  Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled  From that high mount of God, whence light and shade  Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed  To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there  In darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed  All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest;  Wide over all the plain, and wider far  Than all this globous earth in plain outspread,  (Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng,  Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend  By living streams among the trees of life,  Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared,  Celestial tabernacles, where they slept  Fanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course,  Melodious hymns about the sovran throne  Alternate all night long: but not so waked  Satan; so call him now, his former name  Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first,  If not the first Arch-Angel, great in power,  In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught  With envy against the Son of God, that day  Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed

Messiah King anointed, could not bear  Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.  Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,  Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour  Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved  With all his legions to dislodge, and leave  Unworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme,  Contemptuous; and his next subordinate  Awakening, thus to him in secret spake.  Sleepest thou, Companion dear? What sleep can close  Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree  Of yesterday, so late hath passed the lips  Of Heavens Almighty. Thou to me thy thoughts  Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;  Both waking we were one; how then can now  Thy sleep dissent? New laws thou seest imposed;  New laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise  In us who serve, new counsels to debate  What doubtful may ensue: More in this place  To utter is not safe. Assemble thou  Of all those myriads which we lead the chief;  Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim night  Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,  And all who under me their banners wave,  Homeward, with flying march, where we possess  The quarters of the north; there to prepare  Fit entertainment to receive our King,  The great Messiah, and his new commands,  Who speedily through all the hierarchies  
Paradise Lost

Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws.  So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused  Bad influence into the unwary breast  Of his associate: He together calls,  Or several one by one, the regent Powers,  Under him Regent; tells, as he was taught,  That the Most High commanding, now ere night,  Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven,  The great hierarchal standard was to move;  Tells the suggested cause, and casts between  Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound  Or taint integrity: But all obeyed  The wonted signal, and superiour voice  Of their great Potentate; for great indeed  His name, and high was his degree in Heaven;  His countenance, as the morning-star that guides  The starry flock, allured them, and with lies  Drew after him the third part of Heavens host.  Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns  Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount,  And from within the golden lamps that burn  Nightly before him, saw without their light  Rebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread  Among the sons of morn, what multitudes  Were banded to oppose his high decree;  And, smiling, to his only Son thus said.  Son, thou in whom my glory I behold  In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,  Nearly it now concerns us to be sure  
Paradise Lost

Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms  We mean to hold what anciently we claim  Of deity or empire: Such a foe  Is rising, who intends to erect his throne  Equal to ours, throughout the spacious north;  Nor so content, hath in his thought to try  In battle, what our power is, or our right.  Let us advise, and to this hazard draw  With speed what force is left, and all employ  In our defence; lest unawares we lose  This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.  To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear,  Lightning divine, ineffable, serene,  Made answer. Mighty Father, thou thy foes  Justly hast in derision, and, secure,  Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain,  Matter to me of glory, whom their hate  Illustrates, when they see all regal power  Given me to quell their pride, and in event  Know whether I be dextrous to subdue  Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.  So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers,  Far was advanced on winged speed; an host  Innumerable as the stars of night,  Or stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun  Impearls on every leaf and every flower.  Regions they passed, the mighty regencies  Of Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones,  In their triple degrees; regions to which

All thy dominion, Adam, is no more  Than what this garden is to all the earth,  And all the sea, from one entire globose  Stretched into longitude; which having passed,  At length into the limits of the north  They came; and Satan to his royal seat  High on a hill, far blazing, as a mount  Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers  From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold;  The palace of great Lucifer, (so call  That structure in the dialect of men  Interpreted,) which not long after, he  Affecting all equality with God,  In imitation of that mount whereon  Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven,  The Mountain of the Congregation called;  For thither he assembled all his train,  Pretending so commanded to consult  About the great reception of their King,  Thither to come, and with calumnious art  Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears.  Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;  If these magnifick titles yet remain  Not merely titular, since by decree  Another now hath to himself engrossed  All power, and us eclipsed under the name  Of King anointed, for whom all this haste  Of midnight-march, and hurried meeting here,  This only to consult how we may best,  
Paradise Lost 
156 of 374 
With what may be devised of honours new,  Receive him coming to receive from us  Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!  Too much to one! but double how endured,  To one, and to his image now proclaimed?  But what if better counsels might erect  Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?  Will ye submit your necks, and choose to bend  The supple knee? Ye will not, if I trust  To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves  Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before  By none; and if not equal all, yet free,  Equally free; for orders and degrees  Jar not with liberty, but well consist.  Who can in reason then, or right, assume  Monarchy over such as live by right  His equals, if in power and splendour less,  In freedom equal? or can introduce  Law and edict on us, who without law  Err not? much less for this to be our Lord,  And look for adoration, to the abuse  Of those imperial titles, which assert  Our being ordained to govern, not to serve.  Thus far his bold discourse without controul  Had audience; when among the Seraphim  Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored  The Deity, and divine commands obeyed,  Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe  The current of his fury thus opposed.  
Paradise Lost

O argument blasphemous, false, and proud!  Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven  Expected, least of all from thee, Ingrate,  In place thyself so high above thy peers.  Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn  The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,  That to his only Son, by right endued  With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven  Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due  Confess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest,  Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,  And equal over equals to let reign,  One over all with unsucceeded power.  Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute  With him the points of liberty, who made  Thee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven  Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?  Yet, by experience taught, we know how good,  And of our good and of our dignity  How provident he is; how far from thought  To make us less, bent rather to exalt  Our happy state, under one head more near  United. But to grant it thee unjust,  That equal over equals monarch reign:  Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,  Or all angelick nature joined in one,  Equal to him begotten Son? by whom,  As by his Word, the Mighty Father made  All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven  
Paradise Lost

By him created in their bright degrees,  Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named  Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,  Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,  But more illustrious made; since he the head  One of our number thus reduced becomes;  His laws our laws; all honour to him done  Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage,  And tempt not these; but hasten to appease  The incensed Father, and the incensed Son,  While pardon may be found in time besought.  So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal  None seconded, as out of season judged,  Or singular and rash: Whereat rejoiced  The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.  That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work  Of secondary hands, by task transferred  From Father to his Son? strange point and new!  Doctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw  When this creation was? rememberest thou  Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?  We know no time when we were not as now;  Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised  By our own quickening power, when fatal course  Had circled his full orb, the birth mature  Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.  Our puissance is our own; our own right hand  Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try

Who is our equal: Then thou shalt behold  Whether by supplication we intend  Address, and to begirt the almighty throne  Beseeching or besieging. This report,  These tidings carry to the anointed King;  And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.  He said; and, as the sound of waters deep,  Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause  Through the infinite host; nor less for that  The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone  Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.  O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,  Forsaken of all good! I see thy fall  Determined, and thy hapless crew involved  In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread  Both of thy crime and punishment: Henceforth  No more be troubled how to quit the yoke  Of Gods Messiah; those indulgent laws  Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees  Against thee are gone forth without recall;  That golden scepter, which thou didst reject,  Is now an iron rod to bruise and break  Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise;  Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly  These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath  Impendent, raging into sudden flame,  Distinguish not: For soon expect to feel  His thunder on thy head, devouring fire.  Then who created thee lamenting learn,

When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.  So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found  Among the faithless, faithful only he;  Among innumerable false, unmoved,  Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,  His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;  Nor number, nor example, with him wrought  To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,  Though single. From amidst them forth he passed,  Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained  Superiour, nor of violence feared aught;  And, with retorted scorn, his back he turned  On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.

Book VI 
All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued,  Through Heavens wide champain held his way; till Morn,  Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand  Unbarred the gates of light. There is a cave  Within the mount of God, fast by his throne,  Where light and darkness in perpetual round  Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven  Grateful vicissitude, like day and night;  Light issues forth, and at the other door  Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour  To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well  Seem twilight here: And now went forth the Morn  Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold  Empyreal; from before her vanished Night,  Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain  Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,  Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,  Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:  War he perceived, war in procinct; and found  Already known what he for news had thought  To have reported: Gladly then he mixed  Among those friendly Powers, who him received  With joy and acclamations loud, that one,  That of so many myriads fallen, yet one  Returned not lost. On to the sacred hill

They led him high applauded, and present  Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice,  From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.  Servant of God. Well done; well hast thou fought  The better fight, who single hast maintained  Against revolted multitudes the cause  Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms;  And for the testimony of truth hast borne  Universal reproach, far worse to bear  Than violence; for this was all thy care  To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds  Judged thee perverse: The easier conquest now  Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,  Back on thy foes more glorious to return,  Than scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue  By force, who reason for their law refuse,  Right reason for their law, and for their King  Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.  Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince,  And thou, in military prowess next,  Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons  Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints,  By thousands and by millions, ranged for fight,  Equal in number to that Godless crew  Rebellious: Them with fire and hostile arms  Fearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven  Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss,  Into their place of punishment, the gulf  Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide

His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.  So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began  To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll  In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign  Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud  Ethereal trumpet from on high gan blow:  At which command the Powers militant,  That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined  Of union irresistible, moved on  In silence their bright legions, to the sound  Of instrumental harmony, that breathed  Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds  Under their God-like leaders, in the cause  Of God and his Messiah. On they move  Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill,  Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides  Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground  Their march was, and the passive air upbore  Their nimble tread; as when the total kind  Of birds, in orderly array on wing,  Came summoned over Eden to receive  Their names of thee; so over many a tract  Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide,  Tenfold the length of this terrene: At last,  Far in the horizon to the north appeared  From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched  In battailous aspect, and nearer view  Bristled with upright beams innumerable  Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields  
Paradise Lost

Various, with boastful argument portrayed,  The banded Powers of Satan hasting on  With furious expedition; for they weened  That self-same day, by fight or by surprise,  To win the mount of God, and on his throne  To set the Envier of his state, the proud  Aspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain  In the mid way: Though strange to us it seemed  At first, that Angel should with Angel war,  And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet  So oft in festivals of joy and love  Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire,  Hymning the Eternal Father: But the shout  Of battle now began, and rushing sound  Of onset ended soon each milder thought.  High in the midst, exalted as a God,  The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat,  Idol of majesty divine, enclosed  With flaming Cherubim, and golden shields;  Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now  twixt host and host but narrow space was left,  A dreadful interval, and front to front  Presented stood in terrible array  Of hideous length: Before the cloudy van,  On the rough edge of battle ere it joined,  Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,  Came towering, armed in adamant and gold;  Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood  Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,  
Paradise Lost

And thus his own undaunted heart explores.  O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest  Should yet remain, where faith and realty  Remain not: Wherefore should not strength and might  There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove  Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable?  His puissance, trusting in the Almightys aid,  I mean to try, whose reason I have tried  Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,  That he, who in debate of truth hath won,  Should win in arms, in both disputes alike  Victor; though brutish that contest and foul,  When reason hath to deal with force, yet so  Most reason is that reason overcome.  So pondering, and from his armed peers  Forth stepping opposite, half-way he met  His daring foe, at this prevention more  Incensed, and thus securely him defied.  Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached  The highth of thy aspiring unopposed,  The throne of God unguarded, and his side  Abandoned, at the terrour of thy power  Or potent tongue: Fool!not to think how vain  Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms;  Who out of smallest things could, without end,  Have raised incessant armies to defeat  Thy folly; or with solitary hand  Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow,  Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed  
Paradise Lost 
166 of 374 
Thy legions under darkness: But thou seest  All are not of thy train; there be, who faith  Prefer, and piety to God, though then  To thee not visible, when I alone  Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent  From all: My sect thou seest;now learn too late  How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.  Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance,  Thus answered. Ill for thee, but in wished hour  Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest  From flight, seditious Angel! to receive  Thy merited reward, the first assay  Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue,  Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose  A third part of the Gods, in synod met  Their deities to assert; who, while they feel  Vigour divine within them, can allow  Omnipotence to none. But well thou comest  Before thy fellows, ambitious to win  From me some plume, that thy success may show  Destruction to the rest: This pause between,  (Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know,  At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven  To heavenly souls had been all one; but now  I see that most through sloth had rather serve,  Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song!  Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven,  Servility with freedom to contend,  As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.  
Paradise Lost 
167 of 374 
To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.  Apostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find  Of erring, from the path of truth remote:  Unjustly thou depravest it with the name  Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains,  Or Nature: God and Nature bid the same,  When he who rules is worthiest, and excels  Them whom he governs. This is servitude,  To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled  Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,  Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled;  Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.  Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve  In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine  Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed;  Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect: Mean while  From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight,  This greeting on thy impious crest receive.  So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,  Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell  On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,  Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,  Such ruin intercept: Ten paces huge  He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee  His massy spear upstaid; as if on earth  Winds under ground, or waters forcing way,  Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat,  Half sunk with all his pines. Amazement seised  The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see  
Paradise Lost 
168 of 374 
Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout,  Presage of victory, and fierce desire  Of battle: Whereat Michael bid sound  The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven  It sounded, and the faithful armies rung  Hosanna to the Highest: Nor stood at gaze  The adverse legions, nor less hideous joined  The horrid shock. Now storming fury rose,  And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now  Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed  Horrible discord, and the madding wheels  Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise  Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss  Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew,  And flying vaulted either host with fire.  So under fiery cope together rushed  Both battles main, with ruinous assault  And inextinguishable rage. All Heaven  Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth  Had to her center shook. What wonder? when  Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought  On either side, the least of whom could wield  These elements, and arm him with the force  Of all their regions: How much more of power  Army against army numberless to raise  Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,  Though not destroy, their happy native seat;  Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent,  From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled  
Paradise Lost 
169 of 374 
And limited their might; though numbered such  As each divided legion might have seemed  A numerous host; in strength each armed hand  A legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed  Each warriour single as in chief, expert  When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway  Of battle, open when, and when to close  The ridges of grim war: No thought of flight,  None of retreat, no unbecoming deed  That argued fear; each on himself relied,  As only in his arm the moment lay  Of victory: Deeds of eternal fame  Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread  That war and various; sometimes on firm ground  A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,  Tormented all the air; all air seemed then  Conflicting fire. Long time in even scale  The battle hung; till Satan, who that day  Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms  No equal, ranging through the dire attack  Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length  Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled  Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway  Brandished aloft, the horrid edge came down  Wide-wasting; such destruction to withstand  He hasted, and opposed the rocky orb  Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield,  A vast circumference. At his approach  The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil  
Paradise Lost 
170 of 374 
Surceased, and glad, as hoping here to end  Intestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued  Or captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown  And visage all inflamed first thus began.  Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,  Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest  These acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,  Though heaviest by just measure on thyself,  And thy adherents: How hast thou disturbed  Heavens blessed peace, and into nature brought  Misery, uncreated till the crime  Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled  Thy malice into thousands, once upright  And faithful, now proved false! But think not here  To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out  From all her confines. Heaven, the seat of bliss,  Brooks not the works of violence and war.  Hence then, and evil go with thee along,  Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell;  Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils,  Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom,  Or some more sudden vengeance, winged from God,  Precipitate thee with augmented pain.  So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus  The Adversary. Nor think thou with wind  Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds  Thou canst not. Hast thou turned the least of these  To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise  Unvanquished, easier to transact with me  
Paradise Lost 
171 of 374 
That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats  To chase me hence? err not, that so shall end  The strife which thou callest evil, but we style  The strife of glory; which we mean to win,  Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell  Thou fablest; here however to dwell free,  If not to reign: Mean while thy utmost force,  And join him named Almighty to thy aid,  I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.  They ended parle, and both addressed for fight  Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue  Of Angels, can relate, or to what things  Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift  Human imagination to such highth  Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed,  Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms,  Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven.  Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air  Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields  Blazed opposite, while Expectation stood  In horrour: From each hand with speed retired,  Where erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng,  And left large field, unsafe within the wind  Of such commotion; such as, to set forth  Great things by small, if, natures concord broke,  Among the constellations war were sprung,  Two planets, rushing from aspect malign  Of fiercest opposition, in mid sky  Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.  
Paradise Lost 
172 of 374 
Together both with next to almighty arm  Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed  That might determine, and not need repeat,  As not of power at once; nor odds appeared  In might or swift prevention: But the sword  Of Michael from the armoury of God  Was given him tempered so, that neither keen  Nor solid might resist that edge: it met  The sword of Satan, with steep force to smite  Descending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid,  But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared  All his right side: Then Satan first knew pain,  And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore  The griding sword with discontinuous wound  Passed through him: But the ethereal substance closed,  Not long divisible; and from the gash  A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed  Sanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed,  And all his armour stained, ere while so bright.  Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run  By Angels many and strong, who interposed  Defence, while others bore him on their shields  Back to his chariot, where it stood retired  From off the files of war: There they him laid  Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame,  To find himself not matchless, and his pride  Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath  His confidence to equal God in power.  Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout  
Paradise Lost 
173 of 374 
Vital in every part, not as frail man  In entrails, heart of head, liver or reins,  Cannot but by annihilating die;  Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound  Receive, no more than can the fluid air:  All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear,  All intellect, all sense; and, as they please,  They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size  Assume, as?kikes them best, condense or rare.  Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved  Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,  And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array  Of Moloch, furious king; who him defied,  And at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound  Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven  Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon  Down cloven to the waist, with shattered arms  And uncouth pain fled bellowing. On each wing  Uriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe,  Though huge, and in a rock of diamond armed,  Vanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai,  Two potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods  Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,  Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.  Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy  The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow  Ariel, and Arioch, and the violence  Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew.  I might relate of thousands, and their names

Eternize here on earth; but those elect  Angels, contented with their fame in Heaven,  Seek not the praise of men: The other sort,  In might though wonderous and in acts of war,  Nor of renown less eager, yet by doom  Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory,  Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.  For strength from truth divided, and from just,  Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise  And ignominy; yet to glory aspires  Vain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:  Therefore eternal silence be their doom.  And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,  With many an inroad gored; deformed rout  Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground  With shivered armour strown, and on a heap  Chariot and charioteer lay overturned,  And fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled  Oer-wearied, through the faint Satanick host  Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,  Then first with fear surprised, and sense of pain,  Fled ignominious, to such evil brought  By sin of disobedience; till that hour  Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain.  Far otherwise the inviolable Saints,  In cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire,  Invulnerable, impenetrably armed;  Such high advantages their innocence  Gave them above their foes; not to have sinned,

Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood  Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained  By wound, though from their place by violence moved,  Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven  Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,  And silence on the odious din of war:  Under her cloudy covert both retired,  Victor and vanquished: On the foughten field  Michael and his Angels prevalent  Encamping, placed in guard their watches round,  Cherubick waving fires: On the other part,  Satan with his rebellious disappeared,  Far in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest,  His potentates to council called by night;  And in the midst thus undismayed began.  O now in danger tried, now known in arms  Not to be overpowered, Companions dear,  Found worthy not of liberty alone,  Too mean pretence! but what we more affect,  Honour, dominion, glory, and renown;  Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight,  (And if one day, why not eternal days?)  What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send  Against us from about his throne, and judged  Sufficient to subdue us to his will,  But proves not so: Then fallible, it seems,  Of future we may deem him, though till now  Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly armed,  Some disadvantage we endured and pain,  
Paradise Lost 
176 of 374 
Till now not known, but, known, as soon contemned;  Since now we find this our empyreal form  Incapable of mortal injury,  Imperishable, and, though pierced with wound,  Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.  Of evil then so small as easy think  The remedy; perhaps more valid arms,  Weapons more violent, when next we meet,  May serve to better us, and worse our foes,  Or equal what between us made the odds,  In nature none: If other hidden cause  Left them superiour, while we can preserve  Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,  Due search and consultation will disclose.  He sat; and in the assembly next upstood  Nisroch, of Principalities the prime;  As one he stood escaped from cruel fight,  Sore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn,  And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.  Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free  Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard  For Gods, and too unequal work we find,  Against unequal arms to fight in pain,  Against unpained, impassive; from which evil  Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails  Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain  Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands  Of mightiest? Sense of pleasure we may well  Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,  
Paradise Lost

But live content, which is the calmest life:  But pain is perfect misery, the worst  Of evils, and, excessive, overturns  All patience. He, who therefore can invent  With what more forcible we may offend  Our yet unwounded enemies, or arm  Ourselves with like defence, to me deserves  No less than for deliverance what we owe.  Whereto with look composed Satan replied.  Not uninvented that, which thou aright  Believest so main to our success, I bring.  Which of us who beholds the bright surface  Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand,  This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned  With plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems, and gold;  Whose eye so superficially surveys  These things, as not to mind from whence they grow  Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,  Of spiritous and fiery spume, till touched  With Heavens ray, and tempered, they shoot forth  So beauteous, opening to the ambient light?  These in their dark nativity the deep  Shall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame;  Which, into hollow engines, long and round,  Thick rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire  Dilated and infuriate, shall send forth  From far, with thundering noise, among our foes  Such implements of mischief, as shall dash  To pieces, and oerwhelm whatever stands

Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed  The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.  Nor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn,  Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive;  Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joined  Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired.  He ended, and his words their drooping cheer  Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.  The invention all admired, and each, how he  To be the inventer missed; so easy it seemed  Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought  Impossible: Yet, haply, of thy race  In future days, if malice should abound,  Some one intent on mischief, or inspired  With devilish machination, might devise  Like instrument to plague the sons of men  For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.  Forthwith from council to the work they flew;  None arguing stood; innumerable hands  Were ready; in a moment up they turned  Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath  The originals of nature in their crude  Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam  They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art,  Concocted and adusted they reduced  To blackest grain, and into store conveyed:  Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth  Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone,  
Paradise Lost

Whereof to found their engines and their balls  Of missive ruin; part incentive reed  Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.  So all ere day-spring, under conscious night,  Secret they finished, and in order set,  With silent circumspection, unespied.  Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared,  Up rose the victor-Angels, and to arms  The matin trumpet sung: In arms they stood  Of golden panoply, refulgent host,  Soon banded; others from the dawning hills  Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour,  Each quarter to descry the distant foe,  Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,  In motion or in halt: Him soon they met  Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow  But firm battalion; back with speediest sail  Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,  Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried.  Arm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand,  Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit  This day; fear not his flight;so thick a cloud  He comes, and settled in his face I see  Sad resolution, and secure: Let each  His adamantine coat gird well, and each  Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield,  Borne even or high; for this day will pour down,  If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,  But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.  
Paradise Lost

So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon  In order, quit of all impediment;  Instant without disturb they took alarm,  And onward moved embattled: When behold!  Not distant far with heavy pace the foe  Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube  Training his devilish enginery, impaled  On every side with shadowing squadrons deep,  To hide the fraud. At interview both stood  A while; but suddenly at head appeared  Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud.  Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold;  That all may see who hate us, how we seek  Peace and composure, and with open breast  Stand ready to receive them, if they like  Our overture; and turn not back perverse:  But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven!  Heaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge  Freely our part: ye, who appointed stand  Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch  What we propound, and loud that all may hear!  So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce  Had ended; when to right and left the front  Divided, and to either flank retired:  Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange,  A triple mounted row of pillars laid  On wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed,  Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir,  With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,)  
Paradise Lost 
181 of 374 
Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths  With hideous orifice gaped on us wide,  Portending hollow truce: At each behind  A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed  Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense,  Collected stood within our thoughts amused,  Not long; for sudden all at once their reeds  Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied  With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame,  But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,  From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar  Embowelled with outrageous noise the air,  And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul  Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail  Of iron globes; which, on the victor host  Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,  That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,  Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell  By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled;  The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might  Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift  By quick contraction or remove; but now  Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout;  Nor served it to relax their serried files.  What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse  Repeated, and indecent overthrow  Doubled, would render them yet more despised,  And to their foes a laughter; for in view  Stood ranked of Seraphim another row,  
Paradise Lost 
182 of 374 
In posture to displode their second tire  Of thunder: Back defeated to return  They worse abhorred. Satan beheld their plight,  And to his mates thus in derision called.  O Friends! why come not on these victors proud  Ere while they fierce were coming; and when we,  To entertain them fair with open front  And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms  Of composition, straight they changed their minds,  Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,  As they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed  Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps  For joy of offered peace: But I suppose,  If our proposals once again were heard,  We should compel them to a quick result.  To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.  Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight,  Of hard contents, and full of force urged home;  Such as we might perceive amused them all,  And stumbled many: Who receives them right,  Had need from head to foot well understand;  Not understood, this gift they have besides,  They show us when our foes walk not upright.  So they among themselves in pleasant vein  Stood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond  All doubt of victory: Eternal Might  To match with their inventions they presumed  So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn,  And all his host derided, while they stood  
Paradise Lost 
183 of 374 
A while in trouble: But they stood not long;  Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms  Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.  Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power,  Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!)  Their arms away they threw, and to the hills  (For Earth hath this variety from Heaven  Of pleasure situate in hill and dale,)  Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew;  From their foundations loosening to and fro,  They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,  Rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops  Up-lifting bore them in their hands: Amaze,  Be sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host,  When coming towards them so dread they saw  The bottom of the mountains upward turned;  Till on those cursed engines triple-row  They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence  Under the weight of mountains buried deep;  Themselves invaded next, and on their heads  Main promontories flung, which in the air  Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed;  Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised  Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain  Implacable, and many a dolorous groan;  Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind  Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,  Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.  The rest, in imitation, to like arms

Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore:  So hills amid the air encountered hills,  Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire;  That under ground they fought in dismal shade;  Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game  To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped  Upon confusion rose: And now all Heaven  Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread;  Had not the Almighty Father, where he sits  Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure,  Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen  This tumult, and permitted all, advised:  That his great purpose he might so fulfil,  To honour his anointed Son avenged  Upon his enemies, and to declare  All power on him transferred: Whence to his Son,  The Assessour of his throne, he thus began.  Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved,  Son, in whose face invisible is beheld  Visibly, what by Deity I am;  And in whose hand what by decree I do,  Second Omnipotence! two days are past,  Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven,  Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame  These disobedient: Sore hath been their fight,  As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed;  For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest,  Equal in their creation they were formed,  Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought  
Paradise Lost 
185 of 374 
Insensibly, for I suspend their doom;  Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last  Endless, and no solution will be found:  War wearied hath performed what war can do,  And to disordered rage let loose the reins  With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes  Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.  Two days are therefore past, the third is thine;  For thee I have ordained it; and thus far  Have suffered, that the glory may be thine  Of ending this great war, since none but Thou  Can end it. Into thee such virtue and grace  Immense I have transfused, that all may know  In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare;  And, this perverse commotion governed thus,  To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir  Of all things; to be Heir, and to be King  By sacred unction, thy deserved right.  Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Fathers might;  Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels  That shake Heavens basis, bring forth all my war,  My bow and thunder, my almighty arms  Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh;  Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out  From all Heavens bounds into the utter deep:  There let them learn, as likes them, to despise  God, and Messiah his anointed King.  He said, and on his Son with rays direct  Shone full; he all his Father full expressed  
Paradise Lost 
186 of 374 
Ineffably into his face received;  And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.  O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,  First, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seekst  To glorify thy Son, I always thee,  As is most just: This I my glory account,  My exaltation, and my whole delight,  That thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will  Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.  Scepter and power, thy giving, I assume,  And gladlier shall resign, when in the end  Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee  For ever; and in me all whom thou lovest:  But whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on  Thy terrours, as I put thy mildness on,  Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,  Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled;  To their prepared ill mansion driven down,  To chains of darkness, and the undying worm;  That from thy just obedience could revolt,  Whom to obey is happiness entire.  Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure  Far separate, circling thy holy mount,  Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing,  Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief.  So said, he, oer his scepter bowing, rose  From the right hand of Glory where he sat;  And the third sacred morn began to shine,  Dawning through Heaven. Forth rushed with whirlwind 
Paradise Lost 
187 of 374 
sound  The chariot of Paternal Deity,  Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn,  Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed  By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each  Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all  And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels  Of beryl, and careering fires between;  Over their heads a crystal firmament,  Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure  Amber, and colours of the showery arch.  He, in celestial panoply all armed  Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,  Ascended; at his right hand Victory  Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow  And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored;  And from about him fierce effusion rolled  Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire:  Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,  He onward came; far off his coming shone;  And twenty thousand (I their number heard)  Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen;  He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime  On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned,  Illustrious far and wide; but by his own  First seen: Them unexpected joy surprised,  When the great ensign of Messiah blazed  Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven;  Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced  
Paradise Lost 
188 of 374 
His army, circumfused on either wing,  Under their Head imbodied all in one.  Before him Power Divine his way prepared;  At his command the uprooted hills retired  Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went  Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed,  And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.  This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,  And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,  Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.  In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?  But to convince the proud what signs avail,  Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?  They, hardened more by what might most reclaim,  Grieving to see his glory, at the sight  Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth,  Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud  Weening to prosper, and at length prevail  Against God and Messiah, or to fall  In universal ruin last; and now  To final battle drew, disdaining flight,  Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God  To all his host on either hand thus spake.  Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand,  Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest:  Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God  Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause;  And as ye have received, so have ye done,  Invincibly: But of this cursed crew  
Paradise Lost 
189 of 374 
The punishment to other hand belongs;  Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:  Number to this days work is not ordained,  Nor multitude; stand only, and behold  Gods indignation on these godless poured  By me; not you, but me, they have despised,  Yet envied; against me is all their rage,  Because the Father, to whom in Heaven spreme  Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains,  Hath honoured me, according to his will.  Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned;  That they may have their wish, to try with me  In battle which the stronger proves; they all,  Or I alone against them; since by strength  They measure all, of other excellence  Not emulous, nor care who them excels;  Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.  So spake the Son, and into terrour changed  His countenance too severe to be beheld,  And full of wrath bent on his enemies.  At once the Four spread out their starry wings  With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs  Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound  Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.  He on his impious foes right onward drove,  Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels  The stedfast empyrean shook throughout,  All but the throne itself of God. Full soon  Among them he arrived; in his right hand  
Paradise Lost 
190 of 374 
Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent  Before him, such as in their souls infixed  Plagues: They, astonished, all resistance lost,  All courage; down their idle weapons dropt:  Oer shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode  Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,  That wished the mountains now might be again  Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.  Nor less on either side tempestuous fell  His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four  Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels  Distinct alike with multitude of eyes;  One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye  Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire  Among the accursed, that withered all their strength,  And of their wonted vigour left them drained,  Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.  Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked  His thunder in mid volley; for he meant  Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:  The overthrown he raised, and as a herd  Of goats or timorous flock together thronged  Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued  With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds  And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,  Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed  Into the wasteful deep: The monstrous sight  Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse  Urged them behind: Headlong themselves they threw  
Paradise Lost 
191 of 374 
Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath  Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.  Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw  Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled  Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep  Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.  Nine days they fell: Confounded Chaos roared,  And felt tenfold confusion in their fall  Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout  Incumbered him with ruin: Hell at last  Yawning received them whole, and on them closed;  Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire  Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.  Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired  Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled.  Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes,  Messiah his triumphal chariot turned:  To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood  Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts,  With jubilee advanced; and, as they went,  Shaded with branching palm, each Order bright,  Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King,  Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given,  Worthiest to reign: He, celebrated, rode  Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts  And temple of his Mighty Father throned  On high; who into glory him received,  Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.  Thus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth,  
Paradise Lost 
192 of 374 
At thy request, and that thou mayest beware  By what is past, to thee I have revealed  What might have else to human race been hid;  The discord which befel, and war in Heaven  Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall  Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled  With Satan; he who envies now thy state,  Who now is plotting how he may seduce  Thee also from obedience, that, with him  Bereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake  His punishment, eternal misery;  Which would be all his solace and revenge,  As a despite done against the Most High,  Thee once to gain companion of his woe.  But listen not to his temptations, warn  Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard,  By terrible example, the reward  Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,  Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.

Book VII 
Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name  If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine  Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,  Above the flight of Pegasean wing!  The meaning, not the name, I call: for thou  Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top  Of old Olympus dwellest; but, heavenly-born,  Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed,  Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse,  Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play  In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased  With thy celestial song. Up led by thee  Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,  An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air,  Thy tempering: with like safety guided down  Return me to my native element:  Lest from this flying steed unreined, (as once  Bellerophon, though from a lower clime,)  Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,  Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn.  Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound  Within the visible diurnal sphere;  Standing on earth, not rapt above the pole,  More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged  To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,  On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues;  
Paradise Lost 
194 of 374 
In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,  And solitude; yet not alone, while thou  Visitest my slumbers nightly, or when morn  Purples the east: still govern thou my song,  Urania, and fit audience find, though few.  But drive far off the barbarous dissonance  Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race  Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard  In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears  To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned  Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend  Her son. So fail not thou, who thee implores:  For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.  Say, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael,  The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned  Adam, by dire example, to beware  Apostasy, by what befel in Heaven  To those apostates; lest the like befall  In Paradise to Adam or his race,  Charged not to touch the interdicted tree,  If they transgress, and slight that sole command,  So easily obeyed amid the choice  Of all tastes else to please their appetite,  Though wandering. He, with his consorted Eve,  The story heard attentive, and was filled  With admiration and deep muse, to hear  Of things so high and strange; things, to their thought  So unimaginable, as hate in Heaven,  And war so near the peace of God in bliss,  
Paradise Lost 
195 of 374 
With such confusion: but the evil, soon  Driven back, redounded as a flood on those  From whom it sprung; impossible to mix  With blessedness. Whence Adam soon repealed  The doubts that in his heart arose: and now  Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know  What nearer might concern him, how this world  Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began;  When, and whereof created; for what cause;  What within Eden, or without, was done  Before his memory; as one whose drouth  Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream,  Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,  Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest.  Great things, and full of wonder in our ears,  Far differing from this world, thou hast revealed,  Divine interpreter! by favour sent  Down from the empyrean, to forewarn  Us timely of what might else have been our loss,  Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach;  For which to the infinitely Good we owe  Immortal thanks, and his admonishment  Receive, with solemn purpose to observe  Immutably his sovran will, the end  Of what we are. But since thou hast vouchsafed  Gently, for our instruction, to impart  Things above earthly thought, which yet concerned  Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed,  Deign to descend now lower, and relate  
Paradise Lost 
196 of 374 
What may no less perhaps avail us known,  How first began this Heaven which we behold  Distant so high, with moving fires adorned  Innumerable; and this which yields or fills  All space, the ambient air wide interfused  Embracing round this floried Earth; what cause  Moved the Creator, in his holy rest  Through all eternity, so late to build  In Chaos; and the work begun, how soon  Absolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold  What we, not to explore the secrets ask  Of his eternal empire, but the more  To magnify his works, the more we know.  And the great light of day yet wants to run  Much of his race though steep; suspense in Heaven,  Held by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears,  And longer will delay to hear thee tell  His generation, and the rising birth  Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:  Or if the star of evening and the moon  Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring,  Silence; and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch;  Or we can bid his absence, till thy song  End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine.  Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought:  And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.  This also thy request, with caution asked,  Obtain; though to recount almighty works  What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,  
Paradise Lost 
197 of 374 
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?  Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve  To glorify the Maker, and infer  Thee also happier, shall not be withheld  Thy hearing; such commission from above  I have received, to answer thy desire  Of knowledge within bounds; beyond, abstain  To ask; nor let thine own inventions hope  Things not revealed, which the invisible King,  Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in night;  To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:  Enough is left besides to search and know.  But knowledge is as food, and needs no less  Her temperance over appetite, to know  In measure what the mind may well contain;  Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns  Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind.  Know then, that, after Lucifer from Heaven  (So call him, brighter once amidst the host  Of Angels, than that star the stars among,)  Fell with his flaming legions through the deep  Into his place, and the great Son returned  Victorious with his Saints, the Omnipotent  Eternal Father from his throne beheld  Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.  At least our envious Foe hath failed, who thought  All like himself rebellious, by whose aid  This inaccessible high strength, the seat  Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed,  
Paradise Lost 
198 of 374 
He trusted to have seised, and into fraud  Drew many, whom their place knows here no more:  Yet far the greater part have kept, I see,  Their station; Heaven, yet populous, retains  Number sufficient to possess her realms  Though wide, and this high temple to frequent  With ministeries due, and solemn rites:  But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm  Already done, to have dispeopled Heaven,  My damage fondly deemed, I can repair  That detriment, if such it be to lose  Self-lost; and in a moment will create  Another world, out of one man a race  Of men innumerable, there to dwell,  Not here; till, by degrees of merit raised,  They open to themselves at length the way  Up hither, under long obedience tried;  And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth,  One kingdom, joy and union without end.  Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven;  And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee  This I perform; speak thou, and be it done!  My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee  I send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep  Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth;  Boundless the Deep, because I Am who fill  Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.  Though I, uncircumscribed myself, retire,  And put not forth my goodness, which is free

To act or not, Necessity and Chance  Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.  So spake the Almighty, and to what he spake  His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.  Immediate are the acts of God, more swift  Than time or motion, but to human ears  Cannot without process of speech be told,  So told as earthly notion can receive.  Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven,  When such was heard declared the Almightys will;  Glory they sung to the Most High, good will  To future men, and in their dwellings peace;  Glory to Him, whose just avenging ire  Had driven out the ungodly from his sight  And the habitations of the just; to Him  Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained  Good out of evil to create; instead  Of Spirits malign, a better race to bring  Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse  His good to worlds and ages infinite.  So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son  On his great expedition now appeared,  Girt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned  Of Majesty Divine; sapience and love  Immense, and all his Father in him shone.  About his chariot numberless were poured  Cherub, and Seraph, Potentates, and Thrones,  And Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged  From the armoury of God; where stand of old

Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged  Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,  Celestial equipage; and now came forth  Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,  Attendant on their Lord: Heaven opened wide  Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound  On golden hinges moving, to let forth  The King of Glory, in his powerful Word  And Spirit, coming to create new worlds.  On heavenly ground they stood; and from the shore  They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss  Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,  Up from the bottom turned by furious winds  And surging waves, as mountains, to assault  Heavens highth, and with the center mix the pole.  Silence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace,  Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end!  Nor staid; but, on the wings of Cherubim  Uplifted, in paternal glory rode  Far into Chaos, and the world unborn;  For Chaos heard his voice: Him all his train  Followed in bright procession, to behold  Creation, and the wonders of his might.  Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand  He took the golden compasses, prepared  In Gods eternal store, to circumscribe  This universe, and all created things:  One foot he centered, and the other turned  Round through the vast profundity obscure;  
Paradise Lost

And said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds,  This be thy just circumference, O World!  Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,  Matter unformed and void: Darkness profound  Covered the abyss: but on the watery calm  His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,  And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth  Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged  The black tartareous cold infernal dregs,  Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed  Like things to like; the rest to several place  Disparted, and between spun out the air;  And Earth self-balanced on her center hung.  Let there be light, said God; and forthwith Light  Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,  Sprung from the deep; and from her native east  To journey through the aery gloom began,  Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun  Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle  Sojourned the while. God saw the light was good;  And light from darkness by the hemisphere  Divided: light the Day, and darkness Night,  He named. Thus was the first day even and morn:  Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung  By the celestial quires, when orient light  Exhaling first from darkness they beheld;  Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout  The hollow universal orb they filled,  And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised  
Paradise Lost

God and his works; Creator him they sung,  Both when first evening was, and when first morn.  Again, God said, Let there be firmament  Amid the waters, and let it divide  The waters from the waters; and God made  The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,  Transparent, elemental air, diffused  In circuit to the uttermost convex  Of this great round; partition firm and sure,  The waters underneath from those above  Dividing: for as earth, so he the world  Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide  Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule  Of Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes  Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:  And Heaven he named the Firmament: So even  And morning chorus sung the second day.  The Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet  Of waters, embryon immature involved,  Appeared not: over all the face of Earth  Main ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm  Prolifick humour softening all her globe,  Fermented the great mother to conceive,  Satiate with genial moisture; when God said,  Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven  Into one place, and let dry land appear.  Immediately the mountains huge appear  Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave  Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky:  
Paradise Lost 
203 of 374 
So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low  Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,  Capacious bed of waters: Thither they  Hasted with glad precipitance, uprolled,  As drops on dust conglobing from the dry:  Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct,  For haste; such flight the great command impressed  On the swift floods: As armies at the call  Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard)  Troop to their standard; so the watery throng,  Wave rolling after wave, where way they found,  If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain,  Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill;  But they, or under ground, or circuit wide  With serpent errour wandering, found their way,  And on the washy oose deep channels wore;  Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry,  All but within those banks, where rivers now  Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.  The dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle  Of congregated waters, he called Seas:  And saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth  Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed,  And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind,  Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth.  He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then  Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned,  Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad  Her universal face with pleasant green;

Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered  Opening their various colours, and made gay  Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown,  Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept  The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed  Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub,  And bush with frizzled hair implicit: Last  Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread  Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed  Their blossoms: With high woods the hills were crowned;  With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side;  With borders long the rivers: that Earth now  Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell,  Or wander with delight, and love to haunt  Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained  Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground  None was; but from the Earth a dewy mist  Went up, and watered all the ground, and each  Plant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth,  God made, and every herb, before it grew  On the green stem: God saw that it was good:  So even and morn recorded the third day.  Again the Almighty spake, Let there be lights  High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide  The day from night; and let them be for signs,  For seasons, and for days, and circling years;  And let them be for lights, as I ordain  Their office in the firmament of Heaven,  To give light on the Earth; and it was so.  
Paradise Lost 
205 of 374 
And God made two great lights, great for their use  To Man, the greater to have rule by day,  The less by night, altern; and made the stars,  And set them in the firmament of Heaven  To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day  In their vicissitude, and rule the night,  And light from darkness to divide. God saw,  Surveying his great work, that it was good:  For of celestial bodies first the sun  A mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first,  Though of ethereal mould: then formed the moon  Globose, and every magnitude of stars,  And sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field:  Of light by far the greater part he took,  Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed  In the suns orb, made porous to receive  And drink the liquid light; firm to retain  Her gathered beams, great palace now of light.  Hither, as to their fountain, other stars  Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,  And hence the morning-planet gilds her horns;  By tincture or reflection they augment  Their small peculiar, though from human sight  So far remote, with diminution seen,  First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,  Regent of day, and all the horizon round  Invested with bright rays, jocund to run  His longitude through Heavens high road; the gray  Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced,  
Paradise Lost

Shedding sweet influence: Less bright the moon,  But opposite in levelled west was set,  His mirrour, with full face borrowing her light  From him; for other light she needed none  In that aspect, and still that distance keeps  Till night; then in the east her turn she shines,  Revolved on Heavens great axle, and her reign  With thousand lesser lights dividual holds,  With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared  Spangling the hemisphere: Then first adorned  With their bright luminaries that set and rose,  Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day.  And God said, Let the waters generate  Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul:  And let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings  Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven.  And God created the great whales, and each  Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously  The waters generated by their kinds;  And every bird of wing after his kind;  And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying.  Be fruitful, multiply, and in the seas,  And lakes, and running streams, the waters fill;  And let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth.  Forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay,  With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals  Of fish that with their fins, and shining scales,  Glide under the green wave, in sculls that oft  Bank the mid sea: part single, or with mate,  
Paradise Lost 
207 of 374 
Graze the sea-weed their pasture, and through groves  Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance,  Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold;  Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend  Moist nutriment; or under rocks their food  In jointed armour watch: on smooth the seal  And bended dolphins play: part huge of bulk  Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait,  Tempest the ocean: there leviathan,  Hugest of living creatures, on the deep  Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims,  And seems a moving land; and at his gills  Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea.  Mean while the tepid caves, and fens, and shores,  Their brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon  Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed  Their callow young; but feathered soon and fledge  They summed their pens; and, soaring the air sublime,  With clang despised the ground, under a cloud  In prospect; there the eagle and the stork  On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build:  Part loosely wing the region, part more wise  In common, ranged in figure, wedge their way,  Intelligent of seasons, and set forth  Their aery caravan, high over seas  Flying, and over lands, with mutual wing  Easing their flight; so steers the prudent crane  Her annual voyage, borne on winds; the air  Floats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes:  
Paradise Lost 
208 of 374 
From branch to branch the smaller birds with song  Solaced the woods, and spread their painted wings  Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale  Ceased warbling, but all night tund her soft lays:  Others, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed  Their downy breast; the swan with arched neck,  Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows  Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit  The dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower  The mid aereal sky: Others on ground  Walked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds  The silent hours, and the other whose gay train  Adorns him, coloured with the florid hue  Of rainbows and starry eyes. The waters thus  With fish replenished, and the air with fowl,  Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day.  The sixth, and of creation last, arose  With evening harps and matin; when God said,  Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind,  Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth,  Each in their kind. The Earth obeyed, and straight  Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth  Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms,  Limbed and full grown: Out of the ground up rose,  As from his lair, the wild beast where he wons  In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den;  Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked:  The cattle in the fields and meadows green:  Those rare and solitary, these in flocks  
Paradise Lost 
209 of 374 
Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung.  The grassy clods now calved; now half appeared  The tawny lion, pawing to get free  His hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds,  And rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce,  The libbard, and the tiger, as the mole  Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw  In hillocks: The swift stag from under ground  Bore up his branching head: Scarce from his mould  Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved  His vastness: Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose,  As plants: Ambiguous between sea and land  The river-horse, and scaly crocodile.  At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,  Insect or worm: those waved their limber fans  For wings, and smallest lineaments exact  In all the liveries decked of summers pride  With spots of gold and purple, azure and green:  These, as a line, their long dimension drew,  Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all  Minims of nature; some of serpent-kind,  Wonderous in length and corpulence, involved  Their snaky folds, and added wings. First crept  The parsimonious emmet, provident  Of future; in small room large heart enclosed;  Pattern of just equality perhaps  Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes  Of commonalty: Swarming next appeared  The female bee, that feeds her husband drone  
Paradise Lost 
210 of 374 
Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells  With honey stored: The rest are numberless,  And thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names,  Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown  The serpent, subtlest beast of all the field,  Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes  And hairy mane terrifick, though to thee  Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.  Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled  Her motions, as the great first Movers hand  First wheeled their course: Earth in her rich attire  Consummate lovely smiled; air, water, earth,  By fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked,  Frequent; and of the sixth day yet remained:  There wanted yet the master-work, the end  Of all yet done; a creature, who, not prone  And brute as other creatures, but endued  With sanctity of reason, might erect  His stature, and upright with front serene  Govern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence  Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,  But grateful to acknowledge whence his good  Descends, thither with heart, and voice, and eyes  Directed in devotion, to adore  And worship God Supreme, who made him chief  Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent  Eternal Father (for where is not he  Present?) thus to his Son audibly spake.  Let us make now Man in our image, Man  
Paradise Lost 
211 of 374 
In our similitude, and let them rule  Over the fish and fowl of sea and air,  Beast of the field, and over all the Earth,  And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.  This said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man,  Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed  The breath of life; in his own image he  Created thee, in the image of God  Express; and thou becamest a living soul.  Male he created thee; but thy consort  Female, for race; then blessed mankind, and said,  Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth;  Subdue it, and throughout dominion hold  Over fish of the sea, and fowl of the air,  And every living thing that moves on the Earth.  Wherever thus created, for no place  Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest,  He brought thee into this delicious grove,  This garden, planted with the trees of God,  Delectable both to behold and taste;  And freely all their pleasant fruit for food  Gave thee; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,  Variety without end; but of the tree,  Which, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil,  Thou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest;  Death is the penalty imposed; beware,  And govern well thy appetite; lest Sin  Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.  Here finished he, and all that he had made  
Paradise Lost 
212 of 374 
Viewed, and behold all was entirely good;  So even and morn accomplished the sixth day:  Yet not till the Creator from his work  Desisting, though unwearied, up returned,  Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode;  Thence to behold this new created world,  The addition of his empire, how it showed  In prospect from his throne, how good, how fair,  Answering his great idea. Up he rode  Followed with acclamation, and the sound  Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned  Angelick harmonies: The earth, the air  Resounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,)  The heavens and all the constellations rung,  The planets in their station listening stood,  While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.  Open, ye everlasting gates! they sung,  Open, ye Heavens! your living doors;let in  The great Creator from his work returned  Magnificent, his six days work, a World;  Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign  To visit oft the dwellings of just men,  Delighted; and with frequent intercourse  Thither will send his winged messengers  On errands of supernal grace. So sung  The glorious train ascending: He through Heaven,  That opened wide her blazing portals, led  To Gods eternal house direct the way;  A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold  
Paradise Lost 
213 of 374 
And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear,  Seen in the galaxy, that milky way,  Which nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest  Powdered with stars. And now on Earth the seventh  Evening arose in Eden, for the sun  Was set, and twilight from the east came on,  Forerunning night; when at the holy mount  Of Heavens high-seated top, the imperial throne  Of Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure,  The Filial Power arrived, and sat him down  With his great Father; for he also went  Invisible, yet staid, (such privilege  Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained,  Author and End of all things; and, from work  Now resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day,  As resting on that day from all his work,  But not in silence holy kept: the harp  Had work and rested not; the solemn pipe,  And dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop,  All sounds on fret by string or golden wire,  Tempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice  Choral or unison: of incense clouds,  Fuming from golden censers, hid the mount.  Creation and the six days acts they sung:  Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite  Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue  Relate thee! Greater now in thy return  Than from the giant Angels: Thee that day  Thy thunders magnified; but to create  
Paradise Lost 
214 of 374 
Is greater than created to destroy.  Who can impair thee, Mighty King, or bound  Thy empire! Easily the proud attempt  Of Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain,  Thou hast repelled; while impiously they thought  Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw  The number of thy worshippers. Who seeks  To lessen thee, against his purpose serves  To manifest the more thy might: his evil  Thou usest, and from thence createst more good.  Witness this new-made world, another Heaven  From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view  On the clear hyaline, the glassy sea;  Of amplitude almost immense, with stars  Numerous, and every star perhaps a world  Of destined habitation; but thou knowest  Their seasons: among these the seat of Men,  Earth, with her nether ocean circumfused,  Their pleasant dwelling-place. Thrice happy Men,  And sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced!  Created in his image, there to dwell  And worship him; and in reward to rule  Over his works, on earth, in sea, or air,  And multiply a race of worshippers  Holy and just: Thrice happy, if they know  Their happiness, and persevere upright!  So sung they, and the empyrean rung  With halleluiahs: Thus was sabbath kept.  And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked  
Paradise Lost 
215 of 374 
How first this world and face of things began,  And what before thy memory was done  From the beginning; that posterity,  Informed by thee, might know: If else thou seekest  Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.

Book VIII 
The Angel ended, and in Adams ear  So charming left his voice, that he a while  Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear;  Then, as new waked, thus gratefully replied.  What thanks sufficient, or what recompence  Equal, have I to render thee, divine  Historian, who thus largely hast allayed  The thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed  This friendly condescension to relate  Things, else by me unsearchable; now heard  With wonder, but delight, and, as is due,  With glory attributed to the high  Creator! Something yet of doubt remains,  Which only thy solution can resolve.  When I behold this goodly frame, this world,  Of Heaven and Earth consisting; and compute  Their magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain,  An atom, with the firmament compared  And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll  Spaces incomprehensible, (for such  Their distance argues, and their swift return  Diurnal,) merely to officiate light  Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,  One day and night; in all her vast survey  Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire,  How Nature wise and frugal could commit  
Paradise Lost 
217 of 374 
Such disproportions, with superfluous hand  So many nobler bodies to create,  Greater so manifold, to this one use,  For aught appears, and on their orbs impose  Such restless revolution day by day  Repeated; while the sedentary Earth,  That better might with far less compass move,  Served by more noble than herself, attains  Her end without least motion, and receives,  As tribute, such a sumless journey brought  Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;  Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.  So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed  Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve  Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight,  With lowliness majestick from her seat,  And grace that won who saw to wish her stay,  Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,  To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,  Her nursery; they at her coming sprung,  And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.  Yet went she not, as not with such discourse  Delighted, or not capable her ear  Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved,  Adam relating, she sole auditress;  Her husband the relater she preferred  Before the Angel, and of him to ask  Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix  Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute  
Paradise Lost 
218 of 374 
With conjugal caresses: from his lip  Not words alone pleased her. O! when meet now  Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?  With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went,  Not unattended; for on her, as Queen,  A pomp of winning Graces waited still,  And from about her shot darts of desire  Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.  And Raphael now, to Adams doubt proposed,  Benevolent and facile thus replied.  To ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven  Is as the book of God before thee set,  Wherein to read his wonderous works, and learn  His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years:  This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,  Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest  From Man or Angel the great Architect  Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge  His secrets to be scanned by them who ought  Rather admire; or, if they list to try  Conjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens  Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move  His laughter at their quaint opinions wide  Hereafter; when they come to model Heaven  And calculate the stars, how they will wield  The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive  To save appearances; how gird the sphere  With centrick and eccentrick scribbled oer,  Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb:  
Paradise Lost 
219 of 374 
Already by thy reasoning this I guess,  Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest  That bodies bright and greater should not serve  The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,  Earth sitting still, when she alone receives  The benefit: Consider first, that great  Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth  Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,  Nor glistering, may of solid good contain  More plenty than the sun that barren shines;  Whose virtue on itself works no effect,  But in the fruitful Earth; there first received,  His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.  Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries  Officious; but to thee, Earths habitant.  And for the Heavens wide circuit, let it speak  The Makers high magnificence, who built  So spacious, and his line stretched out so far;  That Man may know he dwells not in his own;  An edifice too large for him to fill,  Lodged in a small partition; and the rest  Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.  The swiftness of those circles attribute,  Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,  That to corporeal substances could add  Speed almost spiritual: Me thou thinkest not slow,  Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven  Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived  In Eden; distance inexpressible  
Paradise Lost

By numbers that have name. But this I urge,  Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show  Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;  Not that I so affirm, though so it seem  To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.  God, to remove his ways from human sense,  Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,  If it presume, might err in things too high,  And no advantage gain. What if the sun  Be center to the world; and other stars,  By his attractive virtue and their own  Incited, dance about him various rounds?  Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid,  Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,  In six thou seest; and what if seventh to these  The planet earth, so stedfast though she seem,  Insensibly three different motions move?  Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe,  Moved contrary with thwart obliquities;  Or save the sun his labour, and that swift  Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed,  Invisible else above all stars, the wheel  Of day and night; which needs not thy belief,  If earth, industrious of herself, fetch day  Travelling east, and with her part averse  From the suns beam meet night, her other part  Still luminous by his ray. What if that light,  Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,  To the terrestrial moon be as a star,  
Paradise Lost 
221 of 374 
Enlightening her by day, as she by night  This earth? reciprocal, if land be there,  Fields and inhabitants: Her spots thou seest  As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce  Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat  Allotted there; and other suns perhaps,  With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry,  Communicating male and female light;  Which two great sexes animate the world,  Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.  For such vast room in Nature unpossessed  By living soul, desart and desolate,  Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute  Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far  Down to this habitable, which returns  Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.  But whether thus these things, or whether not;  But whether the sun, predominant in Heaven,  Rise on the earth; or earth rise on the sun;  He from the east his flaming road begin;  Or she from west her silent course advance,  With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps  On her soft axle, while she paces even,  And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along;  Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid;  Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear!  Of other creatures, as him pleases best,  Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou  In what he gives to thee, this Paradise  
Paradise Lost 
222 of 374 
And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high  To know what passes there; be lowly wise:  Think only what concerns thee, and thy being;  Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there  Live, in what state, condition, or degree;  Contented that thus far hath been revealed  Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven.  To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied.  How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure  Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene!  And, freed from intricacies, taught to live  The easiest way; nor with perplexing thoughts  To interrupt the sweet of life, from which  God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares,  And not molest us; unless we ourselves  Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain.  But apt the mind or fancy is to rove  Unchecked, and of her roving is no end;  Till warned, or by experience taught, she learn,  That, not to know at large of things remote  From use, obscure and subtle; but, to know  That which before us lies in daily life,  Is the prime wisdom: What is more, is fume,  Or emptiness, or fond impertinence:  And renders us, in things that most concern,  Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.  Therefore from this high pitch let us descend  A lower flight, and speak of things at hand  Useful; whence, haply, mention may arise  
Paradise Lost 
223 of 374 
Of something not unseasonable to ask,  By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.  Thee I have heard relating what was done  Ere my remembrance: now, hear me relate  My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard;  And day is not yet spent; till then thou seest  How subtly to detain thee I devise;  Inviting thee to hear while I relate;  Fond! were it not in hope of thy reply:  For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven;  And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear  Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst  And hunger both, from labour, at the hour  Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,  Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine  Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety.  To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek.  Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,  Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee  Abundantly his gifts hath also poured  Inward and outward both, his image fair:  Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace  Attends thee; and each word, each motion, forms;  Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth  Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire  Gladly into the ways of God with Man:  For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set  On Man his equal love: Say therefore on;  For I that day was absent, as befel,  
Paradise Lost

Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,  Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell;  Squared in full legion (such command we had)  To see that none thence issued forth a spy,  Or enemy, while God was in his work;  Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold,  Destruction with creation might have mixed.  Not that they durst without his leave attempt;  But us he sends upon his high behests  For state, as Sovran King; and to inure  Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut,  The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong;  But long ere our approaching heard within  Noise, other than the sound of dance or song,  Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.  Glad we returned up to the coasts of light  Ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charge.  But thy relation now; for I attend,  Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.  So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.  For Man to tell how human life began  Is hard; for who himself beginning knew  Desire with thee still longer to converse  Induced me. As new waked from soundest sleep,  Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid,  In balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun  Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.  Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned,  And gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised  
Paradise Lost

By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung,  As thitherward endeavouring, and upright  Stood on my feet: about me round I saw  Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,  And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,  Creatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew;  Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled;  With fragrance and with joy my heart oerflowed.  Myself I then perused, and limb by limb  Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran  With supple joints, as lively vigour led:  But who I was, or where, or from what cause,  Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake;  My tongue obeyed, and readily could name  Whateer I saw. Thou Sun, said I, fair light,  And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay,  Ye Hills, and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains,  And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,  Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?  Not of myself;by some great Maker then,  In goodness and in power pre-eminent:  Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,  From whom I have that thus I move and live,  And feel that I am happier than I know.  While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither,  From where I first drew air, and first beheld  This happy light; when, answer none returned,  On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers,  Pensive I sat me down: There gentle sleep  
Paradise Lost 
226 of 374 
First found me, and with soft oppression seised  My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought  I then was passing to my former state  Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:  When suddenly stood at my head a dream,  Whose inward apparition gently moved  My fancy to believe I yet had being,  And lived: One came, methought, of shape divine,  And said, Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise,  First Man, of men innumerable ordained  First Father! called by thee, I come thy guide  To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.  So saying, by the hand he took me raised,  And over fields and waters, as in air  Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up  A woody mountain; whose high top was plain,  A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees  Planted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw  Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed. Each tree,  Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye  Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite  To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found  Before mine eyes all real, as the dream  Had lively shadowed: Here had new begun  My wandering, had not he, who was my guide  Up hither, from among the trees appeared,  Presence Divine. Rejoicing, but with awe,  In adoration at his feet I fell  Submiss: He reared me, and Whom thou soughtest I am,  
Paradise Lost 
227 of 374 
Said mildly, Author of all this thou seest  Above, or round about thee, or beneath.  This Paradise I give thee, count it thine  To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat:  Of every tree that in the garden grows  Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:  But of the tree whose operation brings  Knowledge of good and ill, which I have set  The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith,  Amid the garden by the tree of life,  Remember what I warn thee, shun to taste,  And shun the bitter consequence: for know,  The day thou eatest thereof, my sole command  Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die,  From that day mortal; and this happy state  Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world  Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounced  The rigid interdiction, which resounds  Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice  Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect  Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed.  Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth  To thee and to thy race I give; as lords  Possess it, and all things that therein live,  Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl.  In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold  After their kinds; I bring them to receive  From thee their names, and pay thee fealty  With low subjection; understand the same

Of fish within their watery residence,  Not hither summoned, since they cannot change  Their element, to draw the thinner air.  As thus he spake, each bird and beast behold  Approaching two and two; these cowering low  With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.  I named them, as they passed, and understood  Their nature, with such knowledge God endued  My sudden apprehension: But in these  I found not what methought I wanted still;  And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed.  O, by what name, for thou above all these,  Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher,  Surpassest far my naming; how may I  Adore thee, Author of this universe,  And all this good to man? for whose well being  So amply, and with hands so liberal,  Thou hast provided all things: But with me  I see not who partakes. In solitude  What happiness, who can enjoy alone,  Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?  Thus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright,  As with a smile more brightened, thus replied.  What callest thou solitude? Is not the Earth  With various living creatures, and the air  Replenished, and all these at thy command  To come and play before thee? Knowest thou not  Their language and their ways? They also know,  And reason not contemptibly: With these  
Paradise Lost

Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.  So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed  So ordering: I, with leave of speech implored,  And humble deprecation, thus replied.  Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power;  My Maker, be propitious while I speak.  Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,  And these inferiour far beneath me set?  Among unequals what society  Can sort, what harmony, or true delight?  Which must be mutual, in proportion due  Given and received; but, in disparity  The one intense, the other still remiss,  Cannot well suit with either, but soon prove  Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak  Such as I seek, fit to participate  All rational delight: wherein the brute  Cannot be human consort: They rejoice  Each with their kind, lion with lioness;  So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined:  Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl  So well converse, nor with the ox the ape;  Worse then can man with beast, and least of all.  Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased.  A nice and subtle happiness, I see,  Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice  Of thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste  No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.  What thinkest thou then of me, and this my state?  
Paradise Lost 
230 of 374 
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed  Of happiness, or not? who am alone  From all eternity; for none I know  Second to me or like, equal much less.  How have I then with whom to hold converse,  Save with the creatures which I made, and those  To me inferiour, infinite descents  Beneath what other creatures are to thee?  He ceased; I lowly answered. To attain  The highth and depth of thy eternal ways  All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things!  Thou in thyself art perfect, and in thee  Is no deficience found: Not so is Man,  But in degree; the cause of his desire  By conversation with his like to help  Or solace his defects. No need that thou  Shouldst propagate, already Infinite;  And through all numbers absolute, though One:  But Man by number is to manifest  His single imperfection, and beget  Like of his like, his image multiplied,  In unity defective; which requires  Collateral love, and dearest amity.  Thou in thy secresy although alone,  Best with thyself accompanied, seekest not  Social communication; yet, so pleased,  Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt  Of union or communion, deified:  I, by conversing, cannot these erect  
Paradise Lost 
231 of 374 
From prone; nor in their ways complacence find.  Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used  Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained  This answer from the gracious Voice Divine.  Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased;  And find thee knowing, not of beasts alone,  Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself;  Expressing well the spirit within thee free,  My image, not imparted to the brute;  Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee  Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike;  And be so minded still: I, ere thou spakest,  Knew it not good for Man to be alone;  And no such company as then thou sawest  Intended thee; for trial only brought,  To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet:  What next I bring shall please thee, be assured,  Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,  Thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire.  He ended, or I heard no more; for now  My earthly by his heavenly overpowered,  Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth  In that celestial colloquy sublime,  As with an object that excels the sense  Dazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair  Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called  By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.  Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell  Of fancy, my internal sight; by which,  
Paradise Lost

Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw,  Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape  Still glorious before whom awake I stood:  Who stooping opened my left side, and took  From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,  And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,  But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed:  The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands;  Under his forming hands a creature grew,  Man-like, but different sex; so lovely fair,  That what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now  Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained  And in her looks; which from that time infused  Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,  And into all things from her air inspired  The spirit of love and amorous delight.  She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked  To find her, or for ever to deplore  Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:  When out of hope, behold her, not far off,  Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned  With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow  To make her amiable: On she came,  Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen,  And guided by his voice; nor uninformed  Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites:  Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye,  In every gesture dignity and love.  I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud.  
Paradise Lost 
233 of 374 
This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled  Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign,  Giver of all things fair! but fairest this  Of all thy gifts! nor enviest. I now see  Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself  Before me: Woman is her name;of Man  Extracted: for this cause he shall forego  Father and mother, and to his wife adhere;  And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.  She heard me thus; and though divinely brought,  Yet innocence, and virgin modesty,  Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,  That would be wooed, and not unsought be won,  Not obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired,  The more desirable; or, to say all,  Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought,  Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned:  I followed her; she what was honour knew,  And with obsequious majesty approved  My pleaded reason. To the nuptial bower  I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven,  And happy constellations, on that hour  Shed their selectest influence; the Earth  Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;  Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs  Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings  Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub,  Disporting, till the amorous bird of night  Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star

On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp.  Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought  My story to the sum of earthly bliss,  Which I enjoy; and must confess to find  In all things else delight indeed, but such  As, used or not, works in the mind no change,  Nor vehement desire; these delicacies  I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers,  Walks, and the melody of birds: but here  Far otherwise, transported I behold,  Transported touch; here passion first I felt,  Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else  Superiour and unmoved; here only weak  Against the charm of Beautys powerful glance.  Or Nature failed in me, and left some part  Not proof enough such object to sustain;  Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps  More than enough; at least on her bestowed  Too much of ornament, in outward show  Elaborate, of inward less exact.  For well I understand in the prime end  Of Nature her the inferiour, in the mind  And inward faculties, which most excel;  In outward also her resembling less  His image who made both, and less expressing  The character of that dominion given  Oer other creatures: Yet when I approach  Her loveliness, so absolute she seems  And in herself complete, so well to know  
Paradise Lost

Her own, that what she wills to do or say,  Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best:  All higher knowledge in her presence falls  Degraded; Wisdom in discourse with her  Loses discountenanced, and like Folly shows;  Authority and Reason on her wait,  As one intended first, not after made  Occasionally; and, to consummate all,  Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat  Build in her loveliest, and create an awe  About her, as a guard angelick placed.  To whom the Angel with contracted brow.  Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part;  Do thou but thine; and be not diffident  Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou  Dismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh,  By attributing overmuch to things  Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest.  For, what admirest thou, what transports thee so,  An outside? fair, no doubt, and worthy well  Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love;  Not thy subjection: Weigh with her thyself;  Then value: Oft-times nothing profits more  Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right  Well managed; of that skill the more thou knowest,  The more she will acknowledge thee her head,  And to realities yield all her shows:  Made so adorn for thy delight the more,  So awful, that with honour thou mayest love  
Paradise Lost

Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.  But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind  Is propagated, seem such dear delight  Beyond all other; think the same vouchsafed  To cattle and each beast; which would not be  To them made common and divulged, if aught  Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue  The soul of man, or passion in him move.  What higher in her society thou findest  Attractive, human, rational, love still;  In loving thou dost well, in passion not,  Wherein true love consists not: Love refines  The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat  In reason, and is judicious; is the scale  By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend,  Not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause,  Among the beasts no mate for thee was found.  To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied.  Neither her outside formed so fair, nor aught  In procreation common to all kinds,  (Though higher of the genial bed by far,  And with mysterious reverence I deem,)  So much delights me, as those graceful acts,  Those thousand decencies, that daily flow  From all her words and actions mixed with love  And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned  Union of mind, or in us both one soul;  Harmony to behold in wedded pair  More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.  
Paradise Lost 
237 of 374 
Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose  What inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled,  Who meet with various objects, from the sense  Variously representing; yet, still free,  Approve the best, and follow what I approve.  To love, thou blamest me not; for Love, thou sayest,  Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide;  Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask:  Love not the heavenly Spirits, and how their love  Express they? by looks only? or do they mix  Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?  To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed  Celestial rosy red, Loves proper hue,  Answered. Let it suffice thee that thou knowest  Us happy, and without love no happiness.  Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest,  (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy  In eminence; and obstacle find none  Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars;  Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace,  Total they mix, union of pure with pure  Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need,  As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.  But I can now no more; the parting sun  Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles  Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.  Be strong, live happy, and love! But, first of all,  Him, whom to love is to obey, and keep  His great command; take heed lest passion sway

Thy judgement to do aught, which else free will  Would not admit: thine, and of all thy sons,  The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!  I in thy persevering shall rejoice,  And all the Blest: Stand fast;to stand or fall  Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.  Perfect within, no outward aid require;  And all temptation to transgress repel.  So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus  Followed with benediction. Since to part,  Go, heavenly guest, ethereal Messenger,  Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore!  Gentle to me and affable hath been  Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever  With grateful memory: Thou to mankind  Be good and friendly still, and oft return!  So parted they; the Angel up to Heaven  From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.

Book IX 
No more of talk where God or Angel guest  With Man, as with his friend, familiar usd,  To sit indulgent, and with him partake  Rural repast; permitting him the while  Venial discourse unblamd. I now must change  Those notes to tragick; foul distrust, and breach  Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt,  And disobedience: on the part of Heaven  Now alienated, distance and distaste,  Anger and just rebuke, and judgement given,  That brought into this world a world of woe,  Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery  Deaths harbinger: Sad talk!yet argument  Not less but more heroick than the wrath  Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued  Thrice fugitive about Troy wall; or rage  Of Turnus for Lavinia disespousd;  Or Neptunes ire, or Junos, that so long  Perplexed the Greek, and Cythereas son: If answerable style I can obtain  Of my celestial patroness, who deigns  Her nightly visitation unimplord,  And dictates to me slumbering; or inspires  Easy my unpremeditated verse:  Since first this subject for heroick song  Pleasd me long choosing, and beginning late;

Not sedulous by nature to indite  Wars, hitherto the only argument  Heroick deemd chief mastery to dissect  With long and tedious havock fabled knights  In battles feignd; the better fortitude  Of patience and heroick martyrdom  Unsung; or to describe races and games,  Or tilting furniture, imblazond shields,  Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds,  Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights  At joust and tournament; then marshalld feast  Servd up in hall with sewers and seneshals;  The skill of artifice or office mean,  Not that which justly gives heroick name  To person, or to poem. Me, of these  Nor skilld nor studious, higher argument  Remains; sufficient of itself to raise  That name, unless an age too late, or cold  Climate, or years, damp my intended wing  Depressd; and much they may, if all be mine,  Not hers, who brings it nightly to my ear.  The sun was sunk, and after him the star  Of Hesperus, whose office is to bring  Twilight upon the earth, short arbiter  twixt day and night, and now from end to end  Nights hemisphere had veild the horizon round:  When satan, who late fled before the threats  Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improvd  In meditated fraud and malice, bent

On Mans destruction, maugre what might hap  Of heavier on himself, fearless returned  From compassing the earth; cautious of day,  Since Uriel, regent of the sun, descried  His entrance, and foreworned the Cherubim  That kept their watch; thence full of anguish driven,  The space of seven continued nights he rode  With darkness; thrice the equinoctial line  He circled; four times crossed the car of night  From pole to pole, traversing each colure;  On the eighth returned; and, on the coast averse  From entrance or Cherubick watch, by stealth  Found unsuspected way. There was a place,  Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change,  Where Tigris, at the foot of Paradise,  Into a gulf shot under ground, till part  Rose up a fountain by the tree of life:  In with the river sunk, and with it rose  Satan, involved in rising mist; then sought  Where to lie hid; sea he had searched, and land,  From Eden over Pontus and the pool  Maeotis, up beyond the river Ob;  Downward as far antarctick; and in length,  West from Orontes to the ocean barred  At Darien ; thence to the land where flows  Ganges and Indus: Thus the orb he roamed  With narrow search; and with inspection deep  Considered every creature, which of all  Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found  
Paradise Lost 
242 of 374 
The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field.  Him after long debate, irresolute  Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose  Fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom  To enter, and his dark suggestions hide  From sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake  Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark,  As from his wit and native subtlety  Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed,  Doubt might beget of diabolick power  Active within, beyond the sense of brute.  Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief  His bursting passion into plaints thus poured.  More justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built  With second thoughts, reforming what was old!  O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred  For what God, after better, worse would build?  Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens  That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps,  Light above light, for thee alone, as seems,  In thee concentring all their precious beams  Of sacred influence! As God in Heaven  Is center, yet extends to all; so thou,  Centring, receivest from all those orbs: in thee,  Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears  Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth  Of creatures animate with gradual life  Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man.  With what delight could I have walked thee round,  
Paradise Lost 
243 of 374 
If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange  Of hill, and valley, rivers, woods, and plains,  Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned,  Rocks, dens, and caves! But I in none of these  Find place or refuge; and the more I see  Pleasures about me, so much more I feel  Torment within me, as from the hateful siege  Of contraries: all good to me becomes  Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state.  But neither here seek I, no nor in Heaven  To dwell, unless by mastering Heavens Supreme;  Nor hope to be myself less miserable  By what I seek, but others to make such  As I, though thereby worse to me redound:  For only in destroying I find ease  To my relentless thoughts; and, him destroyed,  Or won to what may work his utter loss,  For whom all this was made, all this will soon  Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe;  In woe then; that destruction wide may range:  To me shall be the glory sole among  The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred  What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days  Continued making; and who knows how long  Before had been contriving? though perhaps  Not longer than since I, in one night, freed  From servitude inglorious well nigh half  The angelick name, and thinner left the throng  Of his adorers: He, to be avenged,

And to repair his numbers thus impaired,  Whether such virtue spent of old now failed  More Angels to create, if they at least  Are his created, or, to spite us more,  Determined to advance into our room  A creature formed of earth, and him endow,  Exalted from so base original,  With heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed,  He effected; Man he made, and for him built  Magnificent this world, and earth his seat,  Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity!  Subjected to his service angel-wings,  And flaming ministers to watch and tend  Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance  I dread; and, to elude, thus wrapt in mist  Of midnight vapour glide obscure, and pry  In every bush and brake, where hap may find  The serpent sleeping; in whose mazy folds  To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.  O foul descent! that I, who erst contended  With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained  Into a beast; and, mixed with bestial slime,  This essence to incarnate and imbrute,  That to the highth of Deity aspired!  But what will not ambition and revenge  Descend to? Who aspires, must down as low  As high he soared; obnoxious, first or last,  To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet,  Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils:  
Paradise Lost 
245 of 374 
Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed,  Since higher I fall short, on him who next  Provokes my envy, this new favourite  Of Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite,  Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised  From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid.  So saying, through each thicket dank or dry,  Like a black mist low-creeping, he held on  His midnight-search, where soonest he might find  The serpent; him fast-sleeping soon he found  In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled,  His head the midst, well stored with subtile wiles:  Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den,  Nor nocent yet; but, on the grassy herb,  Fearless unfeared he slept: in at his mouth  The Devil entered; and his brutal sense,  In heart or head, possessing, soon inspired  With act intelligential; but his sleep  Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn.  Now, when as sacred light began to dawn  In Eden on the humid flowers, that breathed  Their morning incense, when all things, that breathe,  From the Earths great altar send up silent praise  To the Creator, and his nostrils fill  With grateful smell, forth came the human pair,  And joined their vocal worship to the quire  Of creatures wanting voice; that done, partake  The season prime for sweetest scents and airs:  Then commune, how that day they best may ply

Their growing work: for much their work out-grew  The hands dispatch of two gardening so wide,  And Eve first to her husband thus began.  Adam, well may we labour still to dress  This garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower,  Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands  Aid us, the work under our labour grows,  Luxurious by restraint; what we by day  Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,  One night or two with wanton growth derides  Tending to wild. Thou therefore now advise,  Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present:  Let us divide our labours; thou, where choice  Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind  The woodbine round this arbour, or direct  The clasping ivy where to climb; while I,  In yonder spring of roses intermixed  With myrtle, find what to redress till noon:  For, while so near each other thus all day  Our task we choose, what wonder if so near  Looks intervene and smiles, or object new  Casual discourse draw on; which intermits  Our days work, brought to little, though begun  Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned?  To whom mild answer Adam thus returned.  Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond  Compare above all living creatures dear!  Well hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed,  How we might best fulfil the work which here  
Paradise Lost 
247 of 374 
God hath assigned us; nor of me shalt pass  Unpraised: for nothing lovelier can be found  In woman, than to study houshold good,  And good works in her husband to promote.  Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed  Labour, as to debar us when we need  Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,  Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse  Of looks and smiles; for smiles from reason flow,  To brute denied, and are of love the food;  Love, not the lowest end of human life.  For not to irksome toil, but to delight,  He made us, and delight to reason joined.  These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands  Will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide  As we need walk, till younger hands ere long  Assist us; But, if much converse perhaps  Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield:  For solitude sometimes is best society,  And short retirement urges sweet return.  But other doubt possesses me, lest harm  Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest  What hath been warned us, what malicious foe  Envying our happiness, and of his own  Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame  By sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand  Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find  His wish and best advantage, us asunder;  Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each  
Paradise Lost

To other speedy aid might lend at need:  Whether his first design be to withdraw  Our fealty from God, or to disturb  Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss  Enjoyed by us excites his envy more;  Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side  That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects.  The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,  Safest and seemliest by her husband stays,  Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.  To whom the virgin majesty of Eve,  As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,  With sweet austere composure thus replied.  Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earths Lord!  That such an enemy we have, who seeks  Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn,  And from the parting Angel over-heard,  As in a shady nook I stood behind,  Just then returned at shut of evening flowers.  But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt  To God or thee, because we have a foe  May tempt it, I expected not to hear.  His violence thou fearest not, being such  As we, not capable of death or pain,  Can either not receive, or can repel.  His fraud is then thy fear; which plain infers  Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love  Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced;  Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast,  
Paradise Lost 
249 of 374 
Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?  To whom with healing words Adam replied.  Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve!  For such thou art; from sin and blame entire:  Not diffident of thee do I dissuade  Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid  The attempt itself, intended by our foe.  For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses  The tempted with dishonour foul; supposed  Not incorruptible of faith, not proof  Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn  And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong,  Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,  If such affront I labour to avert  From thee alone, which on us both at once  The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare;  Or daring, first on me the assault shall light.  Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;  Subtle he needs must be, who could seduce  Angels; nor think superfluous others aid.  I, from the influence of thy looks, receive  Access in every virtue; in thy sight  More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were  Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,  Shame to be overcome or over-reached,  Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite.  Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel  When I am present, and thy trial choose  With me, best witness of thy virtue tried?  
Paradise Lost 
250 of 374 
So spake domestick Adam in his care  And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought  Less attributed to her faith sincere,  Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.  If this be our condition, thus to dwell  In narrow circuit straitened by a foe,  Subtle or violent, we not endued  Single with like defence, wherever met;  How are we happy, still in fear of harm?  But harm precedes not sin: only our foe,  Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem  Of our integrity: his foul esteem  Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns  Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared  By us? who rather double honour gain  From his surmise proved false; find peace within,  Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event.  And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed  Alone, without exteriour help sustained?  Let us not then suspect our happy state  Left so imperfect by the Maker wise,  As not secure to single or combined.  Frail is our happiness, if this be so,  And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed.  To whom thus Adam fervently replied.  O Woman, best are all things as the will  Of God ordained them: His creating hand  Nothing imperfect or deficient left  Of all that he created, much less Man,  
Paradise Lost 
251 of 374 
Or aught that might his happy state secure,  Secure from outward force; within himself  The danger lies, yet lies within his power:  Against his will he can receive no harm.  But God left free the will; for what obeys  Reason, is free; and Reason he made right,  But bid her well be ware, and still erect;  Lest, by some fair-appearing good surprised,  She dictate false; and mis-inform the will  To do what God expressly hath forbid.  Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins,  That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me.  Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve;  Since Reason not impossibly may meet  Some specious object by the foe suborned,  And fall into deception unaware,  Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned.  Seek not temptation then, which to avoid  Were better, and most likely if from me  Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.  Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve  First thy obedience; the other who can know,  Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?  But, if thou think, trial unsought may find  Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest,  Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;  Go in thy native innocence, rely  On what thou hast of virtue; summon all!  For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.  
Paradise Lost 
252 of 374 
So spake the patriarch of mankind; but Eve  Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied.  With thy permission then, and thus forewarned  Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words  Touched only; that our trial, when least sought,  May find us both perhaps far less prepared,  The willinger I go, nor much expect  A foe so proud will first the weaker seek;  So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.  Thus saying, from her husbands hand her hand  Soft she withdrew; and, like a Wood-Nymph light,  Oread or Dryad, or of Delias train,  Betook her to the groves; but Delias self  In gait surpassed, and Goddess-like deport,  Though not as she with bow and quiver armed,  But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude,  Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought.  To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned,  Likest she seemed, Pomona when she fled  Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime,  Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove.  Her long with ardent look his eye pursued  Delighted, but desiring more her stay.  Oft he to her his charge of quick return  Repeated; she to him as oft engaged  To be returned by noon amid the bower,  And all things in best order to invite  Noontide repast, or afternoons repose.  O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve,  
Paradise Lost 
253 of 374 
Of thy presumed return! event perverse!  Thou never from that hour in Paradise  Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose;  Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades,  Waited with hellish rancour imminent  To intercept thy way, or send thee back  Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss!  For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend,  Mere serpent in appearance, forth was come;  And on his quest, where likeliest he might find  The only two of mankind, but in them  The whole included race, his purposed prey.  In bower and field he sought, where any tuft  Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay,  Their tendance, or plantation for delight;  By fountain or by shady rivulet  He sought them both, but wished his hap might find  Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope  Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish,  Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,  Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood,  Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round  About her glowed, oft stooping to support  Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay  Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold,  Hung drooping unsustained; them she upstays  Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while  Herself, though fairest unsupported flower,  From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.  
Paradise Lost 
254 of 374 
Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed  Of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm;  Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen,  Among thick-woven arborets, and flowers  Imbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve:  Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned  Or of revived Adonis, or renowned  Alcinous, host of old Laertes son;  Or that, not mystick, where the sapient king  Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse.  Much he the place admired, the person more.  As one who long in populous city pent,  Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,  Forth issuing on a summers morn, to breathe  Among the pleasant villages and farms  Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight;  The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,  Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound;  If chance, with nymph-like step, fair virgin pass,  What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more;  She most, and in her look sums all delight:  Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold  This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve  Thus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form  Angelick, but more soft, and feminine,  Her graceful innocence, her every air  Of gesture, or least action, overawed  His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved  His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:  
Paradise Lost 
255 of 374 
That space the Evil-one abstracted stood  From his own evil, and for the time remained  Stupidly good; of enmity disarmed,  Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge:  But the hot Hell that always in him burns,  Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight,  And tortures him now more, the more he sees  Of pleasure, not for him ordained: then soon  Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts  Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.  Thoughts, whither have ye led me! with what sweet  Compulsion thus transported, to forget  What hither brought us! hate, not love;nor hope  Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste  Of pleasure; but all pleasure to destroy,  Save what is in destroying; other joy  To me is lost. Then, let me not let pass  Occasion which now smiles; behold alone  The woman, opportune to all attempts,  Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh,  Whose higher intellectual more I shun,  And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb  Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould;  Foe not informidable! exempt from wound,  I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain  Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven.  She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods!  Not terrible, though terrour be in love  And beauty, not approached by stronger hate,  
Paradise Lost 
256 of 374 
Hate stronger, under show of love well feigned;  The way which to her ruin now I tend.  So spake the enemy of mankind, enclosed  In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve  Addressed his way: not with indented wave,  Prone on the ground, as since; but on his rear,  Circular base of rising folds, that towered  Fold above fold, a surging maze! his head  Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes;  With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect  Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass  Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape  And lovely; never since of serpent-kind  Lovelier, not those that in Illyria changed,  Hermione and Cadmus, or the god  In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed  Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen;  He with Olympias; this with her who bore  Scipio, the highth of Rome. With tract oblique  At first, as one who sought access, but feared  To interrupt, side-long he works his way.  As when a ship, by skilful steersmen wrought  Nigh rivers mouth or foreland, where the wind  Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail:  So varied he, and of his tortuous train  Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,  To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound  Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as used  To such disport before her through the field,  
Paradise Lost 
257 of 374 
From every beast; more duteous at her call,  Than at Circean call the herd disguised.  He, bolder now, uncalled before her stood,  But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed  His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck,  Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod.  His gentle dumb expression turned at length  The eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad  Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue  Organick, or impulse of vocal air,  His fraudulent temptation thus began.  Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps  Thou canst, who art sole wonder! much less arm  Thy looks, the Heaven of mildness, with disdain,  Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze  Insatiate; I thus single;nor have feared  Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.  Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair,  Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine  By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore  With ravishment beheld! there best beheld,  Where universally admired; but here  In this enclosure wild, these beasts among,  Beholders rude, and shallow to discern  Half what in thee is fair, one man except,  Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen  A Goddess among Gods, adored and served  By Angels numberless, thy daily train.  So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned:  
Paradise Lost 
258 of 374 
Into the heart of Eve his words made way,  Though at the voice much marvelling; at length,  Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake.  What may this mean? language of man pronounced  By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed?  The first, at least, of these I thought denied  To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day,  Created mute to all articulate sound:  The latter I demur; for in their looks  Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears.  Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field  I knew, but not with human voice endued;  Redouble then this miracle, and say,  How camest thou speakable of mute, and how  To me so friendly grown above the rest  Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?  Say, for such wonder claims attention due.  To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied.  Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve!  Easy to me it is to tell thee all  What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed:  I was at first as other beasts that graze  The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low,  As was my food; nor aught but food discerned  Or sex, and apprehended nothing high:  Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced  A goodly tree far distant to behold  Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed,  
Paradise Lost 
259 of 374 
Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze;  When from the boughs a savoury odour blown,  Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense  Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats  Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even,  Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play.  To satisfy the sharp desire I had  Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved  Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once,  Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent  Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen.  About the mossy trunk I wound me soon;  For, high from ground, the branches would require  Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the tree  All other beasts that saw, with like desire  Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.  Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung  Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill  I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour,  At feed or fountain, never had I found.  Sated at length, ere long I might perceive  Strange alteration in me, to degree  Of reason in my inward powers; and speech  Wanted not long; though to this shape retained.  Thenceforth to speculations high or deep  I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind  Considered all things visible in Heaven,  Or Earth, or Middle; all things fair and good:  But all that fair and good in thy divine  
Paradise Lost 
260 of 374 
Semblance, and in thy beautys heavenly ray,  United I beheld; no fair to thine  Equivalent or second! which compelled  Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come  And gaze, and worship thee of right declared  Sovran of creatures, universal Dame!  So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve,  Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied.  Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt  The virtue of that fruit, in thee first proved:  But say, where grows the tree? from hence how far?  For many are the trees of God that grow  In Paradise, and various, yet unknown  To us; in such abundance lies our choice,  As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched,  Still hanging incorruptible, till men  Grow up to their provision, and more hands  Help to disburden Nature of her birth.  To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad.  Empress, the way is ready, and not long;  Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat,  Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past  Of blowing myrrh and balm: if thou accept  My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon  Lead then, said Eve. He, leading, swiftly rolled  In tangles, and made intricate seem straight,  To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy  Brightens his crest; as when a wandering fire,  Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night  
Paradise Lost 
261 of 374 
Condenses, and the cold environs round,  Kindled through agitation to a flame,  Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,  Hovering and blazing with delusive light,  Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way  To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool;  There swallowed up and lost, from succour far.  So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud  Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the tree  Of prohibition, root of all our woe;  Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.  Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither,  Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess,  The credit of whose virtue rest with thee;  Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects.  But of this tree we may not taste nor touch;  God so commanded, and left that command  Sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live  Law to ourselves; our reason is our law.  To whom the Tempter guilefully replied.  Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit  Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat,  Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air$?  To whom thus Eve, yet sinless. Of the fruit  Of each tree in the garden we may eat;  But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst  The garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat  Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  She scarce had said, though brief, when now more bold  
Paradise Lost 
262 of 374 
The Tempter, but with show of zeal and love  To Man, and indignation at his wrong,  New part puts on; and, as to passion moved,  Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act  Raised, as of some great matter to begin.  As when of old some orator renowned,  In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence  Flourished, since mute! to some great cause addressed,  Stood in himself collected; while each part,  Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue;  Sometimes in highth began, as no delay  Of preface brooking, through his zeal of right:  So standing, moving, or to highth up grown,  The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began.  O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plant,  Mother of science! now I feel thy power  Within me clear; not only to discern  Things in their causes, but to trace the ways  Of highest agents, deemed however wise.  Queen of this universe! do not believe  Those rigid threats of death: ye shall not die:  How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life  To knowledge; by the threatener? look on me,  Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live,  And life more perfect have attained than Fate  Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot.  Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast  Is open? or will God incense his ire  For such a petty trespass? and not praise  
Paradise Lost 
263 of 374 
Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain  Of death denounced, whatever thing death be,  Deterred not from achieving what might lead  To happier life, knowledge of good and evil;  Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil  Be real, why not known, since easier shunned?  God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;  Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed:  Your fear itself of death removes the fear.  Why then was this forbid? Why, but to awe;  Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant,  His worshippers? He knows that in the day  Ye eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clear,  Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then  Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods,  Knowing both good and evil, as they know.  That ye shall be as Gods, since I as Man,  Internal Man, is but proportion meet;  I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods.  So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off  Human, to put on Gods; death to be wished,  Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring.  And what are Gods, that Man may not become  As they, participating God-like food?  The Gods are first, and that advantage use  On our belief, that all from them proceeds:  I question it; for this fair earth I see,  Warmed by the sun, producing every kind;  Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclosed  
Paradise Lost 
264 of 374 
Knowledge of good and evil in this tree,  That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains  Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies  The offence, that Man should thus attain to know?  What can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree  Impart against his will, if all be his?  Or is it envy? and can envy dwell  In heavenly breasts? These, these, and many more  Causes import your need of this fair fruit.  Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste!  He ended; and his words, replete with guile,  Into her heart too easy entrance won:  Fixed on the fruit she gazed, which to behold  Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound  Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned  With reason, to her seeming, and with truth:  Mean while the hour of noon drew on, and waked  An eager appetite, raised by the smell  So savoury of that fruit, which with desire,  Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,  Solicited her longing eye; yet first  Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused.  Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits,  Though kept from man, and worthy to be admired;  Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay  Gave elocution to the mute, and taught  The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise:  Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use,  Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree  
Paradise Lost 
265 of 374 
Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;  Forbids us then to taste! but his forbidding  Commends thee more, while it infers the good  By thee communicated, and our want:  For good unknown sure is not had; or, had  And yet unknown, is as not had at all.  In plain then, what forbids he but to know,  Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?  Such prohibitions bind not. But, if death  Bind us with after-bands, what profits then  Our inward freedom? In the day we eat  Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die!  How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives,  And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,  Irrational till then. For us alone  Was death invented? or to us denied  This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?  For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first  Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy  The good befallen him, author unsuspect,  Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile.  What fear I then? rather, what know to fear  Under this ignorance of good and evil,  Of God or death, of law or penalty?  Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine,  Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,  Of virtue to make wise: What hinders then  To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?  So saying, her rash hand in evil hour  
Paradise Lost 
266 of 374 
Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat!  Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat,  Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe,  That all was lost. Back to the thicket slunk  The guilty Serpent; and well might;for Eve,  Intent now wholly on her taste, nought else  Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed,  In fruit she never tasted, whether true  Or fancied so, through expectation high  Of knowledge; not was Godhead from her thought.  Greedily she ingorged without restraint,  And knew not eating death: Satiate at length,  And hightened as with wine, jocund and boon,  Thus to herself she pleasingly began.  O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees  In Paradise! of operation blest  To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed.  And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end  Created; but henceforth my early care,  Not without song, each morning, and due praise,  Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease  Of thy full branches offered free to all;  Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature  In knowledge, as the Gods, who all things know;  Though others envy what they cannot give:  For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here  Thus grown. Experience, next, to thee I owe,  Best guide; not following thee, I had remained  In ignorance; thou openest wisdoms way,  
Paradise Lost 
267 of 374 
And givest access, though secret she retire.  And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high,  High, and remote to see from thence distinct  Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps  May have diverted from continual watch  Our great Forbidder, safe with all his spies  About him. But to Adam in what sort  Shall I appear? shall I to him make known  As yet my change, and give him to partake  Full happiness with me, or rather not,  But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power  Without copartner? so to add what wants  In female sex, the more to draw his love,  And render me more equal; and perhaps,  A thing not undesirable, sometime  Superiour; for, inferiour, who is free  This may be well: But what if God have seen,  And death ensue? then I shall be no more!  And Adam, wedded to another Eve,  Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;  A death to think! Confirmed then I resolve,  Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe:  So dear I love him, that with him all deaths  I could endure, without him live no life.  So saying, from the tree her step she turned;  But first low reverence done, as to the Power  That dwelt within, whose presence had infused  Into the plant sciential sap, derived  From nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while,  
Paradise Lost 
268 of 374 
Waiting desirous her return, had wove  Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn  Her tresses, and her rural labours crown;  As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.  Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new  Solace in her return, so long delayed:  Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill,  Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt;  And forth to meet her went, the way she took  That morn when first they parted: by the tree  Of knowledge he must pass; there he her met,  Scarce from the tree returning; in her hand  A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled,  New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.  To him she hasted; in her face excuse  Came prologue, and apology too prompt;  Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed.  Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?  Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived  Thy presence; agony of love till now  Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more  Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought,  The pain of absence from thy sight. But strange  Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear:  This tree is not, as we are told, a tree  Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown  Opening the way, but of divine effect  To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste;  And hath been tasted such: The serpent wise,  
Paradise Lost 
269 of 374 
Or not restrained as we, or not obeying,  Hath eaten of the fruit; and is become,  Not dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth  Endued with human voice and human sense,  Reasoning to admiration; and with me  Persuasively hath so prevailed, that I  Have also tasted, and have also found  The effects to correspond; opener mine eyes,  Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart,  And growing up to Godhead; which for thee  Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.  For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss;  Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon.  Thou therefore also taste, that equal lot  May join us, equal joy, as equal love;  Lest, thou not tasting, different degree  Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce  Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit.  Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;  But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed.  On the other side Adam, soon as he heard  The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed,  Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill  Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed;  From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve  Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed:  Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length  First to himself he inward silence broke.  O fairest of Creation, last and best  
Paradise Lost 
270 of 374 
Of all Gods works, Creature in whom excelled  Whatever can to sight or thought be formed,  Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!  How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost,  Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!  Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress  The strict forbiddance, how to violate  The sacred fruit forbidden! Some cursed fraud  Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,  And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee  Certain my resolution is to die:  How can I live without thee! how forego  Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined,  To live again in these wild woods forlorn!  Should God create another Eve, and I  Another rib afford, yet loss of thee  Would never from my heart: no, no!I feel  The link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh,  Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state  Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.  So having said, as one from sad dismay  Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed  Submitting to what seemed remediless,  Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned.  Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve,  And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared,  Had it been only coveting to eye  That sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence,  Much more to taste it under ban to touch.  
Paradise Lost 
271 of 374 
But past who can recall, or done undo?  Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate; yet so  Perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact  Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit,  Profaned first by the serpent, by him first  Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste;  Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives;  Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man,  Higher degree of life; inducement strong  To us, as likely tasting to attain  Proportional ascent; which cannot be  But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods.  Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,  Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy  Us his prime creatures, dignified so high,  Set over all his works; which in our fall,  For us created, needs with us must fail,  Dependant made; so God shall uncreate,  Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose;  Not well conceived of God, who, though his power  Creation could repeat, yet would be loth  Us to abolish, lest the Adversary  Triumph, and say; Fickle their state whom God  Most favours; who can please him long? Me first  He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?  Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe.  However I with thee have fixed my lot,  Certain to undergo like doom: If death  Consort with thee, death is to me as life;

So forcible within my heart I feel  The bond of Nature draw me to my own;  My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;  Our state cannot be severed; we are one,  One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.  So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied.  O glorious trial of exceeding love,  Illustrious evidence, example high!  Engaging me to emulate; but, short  Of thy perfection, how shall I attain,  Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung,  And gladly of our union hear thee speak,  One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof  This day affords, declaring thee resolved,  Rather than death, or aught than death more dread,  Shall separate us, linked in love so dear,  To undergo with me one guilt, one crime,  If any be, of tasting this fair fruit;  Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds,  Direct, or by occasion, hath presented  This happy trial of thy love, which else  So eminently never had been known?  Were it I thought death menaced would ensue  This my attempt, I would sustain alone  The worst, and not persuade thee, rather die  Deserted, than oblige thee with a fact  Pernicious to thy peace; chiefly assured  Remarkably so late of thy so true,  So faithful, love unequalled: but I feel

Far otherwise the event; not death, but life  Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys,  Taste so divine, that what of sweet before  Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.  On my experience, Adam, freely taste,  And fear of death deliver to the winds.  So saying, she embraced him, and for joy  Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love  Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur  Divine displeasure for her sake, or death.  In recompence for such compliance bad  Such recompence best merits from the bough  She gave him of that fair enticing fruit  With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat,  Against his better knowledge; not deceived,  But fondly overcome with female charm.  Earth trembled from her entrails, as again  In pangs; and Nature gave a second groan;  Sky loured; and, muttering thunder, some sad drops  Wept at completing of the mortal sin  Original: while Adam took no thought,  Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate  Her former trespass feared, the more to sooth  Him with her loved society; that now,  As with new wine intoxicated both,  They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel  Divinity within them breeding wings,  Wherewith to scorn the earth: But that false fruit  Far other operation first displayed,  
Paradise Lost

Carnal desire inflaming; he on Eve  Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him  As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn:  Till Adam thus gan Eve to dalliance move.  Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste,  And elegant, of sapience no small part;  Since to each meaning savour we apply,  And palate call judicious; I the praise  Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed.  Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained  From this delightful fruit, nor known till now  True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be  In things to us forbidden, it might be wished,  For this one tree had been forbidden ten.  But come, so well refreshed, now let us play,  As meet is, after such delicious fare;  For never did thy beauty, since the day  I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned  With all perfections, so inflame my sense  With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now  Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree!  So said he, and forbore not glance or toy  Of amorous intent; well understood  Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire.  Her hand he seised; and to a shady bank,  Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered,  He led her nothing loth; flowers were the couch,  Pansies, and violets, and asphodel,  And hyacinth; Earths freshest softest lap.  
Paradise Lost 
275 of 374 
There they their fill of love and loves disport  Took largely, of their mutual guilt the seal,  The solace of their sin; till dewy sleep  Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play,  Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit,  That with exhilarating vapour bland  About their spirits had played, and inmost powers  Made err, was now exhaled; and grosser sleep,  Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams  Incumbered, now had left them; up they rose  As from unrest; and, each the other viewing,  Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds  How darkened; innocence, that as a veil  Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone;  Just confidence, and native righteousness,  And honour, from about them, naked left  To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe  Uncovered more. So rose the Danite strong,  Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap  Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked  Shorn of his strength. They destitute and bare  Of all their virtue: Silent, and in face  Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute:  Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed,  At length gave utterance to these words constrained.  O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear  To that false worm, of whomsoever taught  To counterfeit Mans voice; true in our fall,  False in our promised rising; since our eyes  
Paradise Lost 
276 of 374 
Opened we find indeed, and find we know  Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got;  Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know;  Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void,  Of innocence, of faith, of purity,  Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained,  And in our faces evident the signs  Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;  Even shame, the last of evils; of the first  Be sure then.How shall I behold the face  Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy  And rapture so oft beheld? Those heavenly shapes  Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze  Insufferably bright. O! might I here  In solitude live savage; in some glade  Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable  To star or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad  And brown as evening: Cover me, ye Pines!  Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs  Hide me, where I may never see them more!  But let us now, as in bad plight, devise  What best may for the present serve to hide  The parts of each from other, that seem most  To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen;  Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves together sewed,  And girded on our loins, may cover round  Those middle parts; that this new comer, Shame,  There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.  So counselled he, and both together went  
Paradise Lost

Into the thickest wood; there soon they chose  The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned,  But such as at this day, to Indians known,  In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms  Branching so broad and long, that in the ground  The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow  About the mother tree, a pillared shade  High over-arched, and echoing walks between:  There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,  Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds  At loop-holes cut through thickest shade: Those leaves  They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe;  And, with what skill they had, together sewed,  To gird their waist; vain covering, if to hide  Their guilt and dreaded shame! O, how unlike  To that first naked glory! Such of late  Columbus found the American, so girt  With feathered cincture; naked else, and wild  Among the trees on isles and woody shores.  Thus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part  Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind,  They sat them down to weep; nor only tears  Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within  Began to rise, high passions, anger, hate,  Mistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore  Their inward state of mind, calm region once  And full of peace, now tost and turbulent:  For Understanding ruled not, and the Will  Heard not her lore; both in subjection now  
Paradise Lost

To sensual Appetite, who from beneath  Usurping over sovran Reason claimed  Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast,  Adam, estranged in look and altered style,  Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed.  Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and staid  With me, as I besought thee, when that strange  Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn,  I know not whence possessed thee; we had then  Remained still happy; not, as now, despoiled  Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable!  Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve  The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek  Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail.  To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve.  What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe!  Imputest thou that to my default, or will  Of wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows  But might as ill have happened thou being by,  Or to thyself perhaps? Hadst thou been there,  Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned  Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;  No ground of enmity between us known,  Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm.  Was I to have never parted from thy side?  As good have grown there still a lifeless rib.  Being as I am, why didst not thou, the head,  Command me absolutely not to go,  Going into such danger, as thou saidst?  
Paradise Lost 
279 of 374 
Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay;  Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.  Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent,  Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me.  To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied.  Is this the love, is this the recompence  Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed  Immutable, when thou wert lost, not I;  Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss,  Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?  And am I now upbraided as the cause  Of thy transgressing? Not enough severe,  It seems, in thy restraint: What could I more  I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold  The danger, and the lurking enemy  That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force;  And force upon free will hath here no place.  But confidence then bore thee on; secure  Either to meet no danger, or to find  Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps  I also erred, in overmuch admiring  What seemed in thee so perfect, that I thought  No evil durst attempt thee; but I rue  The errour now, which is become my crime,  And thou the accuser. Thus it shall befall  Him, who, to worth in women overtrusting,  Lets her will rule: restraint she will not brook;  And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue,  She first his weak indulgence will accuse.  
Paradise Lost 
280 of 374 
Thus they in mutual accusation spent  The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning;  And of their vain contest appeared no end.

Book X  
Mean while the heinous and despiteful act  Of Satan, done in Paradise; and how  He, in the serpent, had perverted Eve,  Her husband she, to taste the fatal fruit,  Was known in Heaven; for what can scape the eye  Of God all-seeing, or deceive his heart  Omniscient? who, in all things wise and just,  Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind  Of Man, with strength entire and free will armed,  Complete to have discovered and repulsed  Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend.  For still they knew, and ought to have still remembered,  The high injunction, not to taste that fruit,  Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,  (Incurred what could they less?) the penalty;  And, manifold in sin, deserved to fall.  Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste  The angelick guards ascended, mute, and sad,  For Man; for of his state by this they knew,  Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen  Entrance unseen. Soon as the unwelcome news  From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased  All were who heard; dim sadness did not spare  That time celestial visages, yet, mixed  With pity, violated not their bliss.  About the new-arrived, in multitudes

The ethereal people ran, to hear and know  How all befel: They towards the throne supreme,  Accountable, made haste, to make appear,  With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance  And easily approved; when the Most High  Eternal Father, from his secret cloud,  Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice.  Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned  From unsuccessful charge; be not dismayed,  Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth,  Which your sincerest care could not prevent;  Foretold so lately what would come to pass,  When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell.  I told ye then he should prevail, and speed  On his bad errand; Man should be seduced,  And flattered out of all, believing lies  Against his Maker; no decree of mine  Concurring to necessitate his fall,  Or touch with lightest moment of impulse  His free will, to her own inclining left  In even scale. But fallen he is; and now  What rests, but that the mortal sentence pass  On his transgression,death denounced that day?  Which he presumes already vain and void,  Because not yet inflicted, as he feared,  By some immediate stroke; but soon shall find  Forbearance no acquittance, ere day end.  Justice shall not return as bounty scorned.  But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee,  
Paradise Lost 
283 of 374 
Vicegerent Son? To thee I have transferred  All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell.  Easy it may be seen that I intend  Mercy colleague with justice, sending thee  Mans friend, his Mediator, his designed  Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary,  And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen.  So spake the Father; and, unfolding bright  Toward the right hand his glory, on the Son  Blazed forth unclouded Deity: He full  Resplendent all his Father manifest  Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild.  Father Eternal, thine is to decree;  Mine, both in Heaven and Earth, to do thy will  Supreme; that thou in me, thy Son beloved,  Mayest ever rest well pleased. I go to judge  On earth these thy transgressours; but thou knowest,  Whoever judged, the worst on me must light,  When time shall be; for so I undertook  Before thee; and, not repenting, this obtain  Of right, that I may mitigate their doom  On me derived; yet I shall temper so  Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most  Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.  Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none  Are to behold the judgement, but the judged,  Those two; the third best absent is condemned,  Convict by flight, and rebel to all law:  Conviction to the serpent none belongs.  
Paradise Lost

Thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose  Of high collateral glory: Him Thrones, and Powers,  Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant,  Accompanied to Heaven-gate; from whence  Eden, and all the coast, in prospect lay.  Down he descended straight; the speed of Gods  Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged.  Now was the sun in western cadence low  From noon, and gentle airs, due at their hour,  To fan the earth now waked, and usher in  The evening cool; when he, from wrath more cool,  Came the mild Judge, and Intercessour both,  To sentence Man: The voice of God they heard  Now walking in the garden, by soft winds  Brought to their ears, while day declined; they heard,  And from his presence hid themselves among  The thickest trees, both man and wife; till God,  Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud.  Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet  My coming seen far off? I miss thee here,  Not pleased, thus entertained with solitude,  Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought:  Or come I less conspicuous, or what change  Absents thee, or what chance detains?Come forth!  He came; and with him Eve, more loth, though first  To offend; discountenanced both, and discomposed;  Love was not in their looks, either to God,  Or to each other; but apparent guilt,  And shame, and perturbation, and despair,  
Paradise Lost 
285 of 374 
Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile.  Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief.  I heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice  Afraid, being naked, hid myself. To whom  The gracious Judge without revile replied.  My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feared,  But still rejoiced; how is it now become  So dreadful to thee? That thou art naked, who  Hath told thee? Hast thou eaten of the tree,  Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?  To whom thus Adam sore beset replied.  O Heaven! in evil strait this day I stand  Before my Judge; either to undergo  Myself the total crime, or to accuse  My other self, the partner of my life;  Whose failing, while her faith to me remains,  I should conceal, and not expose to blame  By my complaint: but strict necessity  Subdues me, and calamitous constraint;  Lest on my head both sin and punishment,  However insupportable, be all  Devolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou  Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.  This Woman, whom thou madest to be my help,  And gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good,  So fit, so acceptable, so divine,  That from her hand I could suspect no ill,  And what she did, whatever in itself,  Her doing seemed to justify the deed;  
Paradise Lost 
286 of 374 
She gave me of the tree, and I did eat.  To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied.  Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey  Before his voice? or was she made thy guide,  Superiour, or but equal, that to her  Thou didst resign thy manhood, and the place  Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,  And for thee, whose perfection far excelled  Hers in all real dignity? Adorned  She was indeed, and lovely, to attract  Thy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts  Were such, as under government well seemed;  Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part  And person, hadst thou known thyself aright.  So having said, he thus to Eve in few.  Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done?  To whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed,  Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge  Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied.  The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat.  Which when the Lord God heard, without delay  To judgement he proceeded on the accused  Serpent, though brute; unable to transfer  The guilt on him, who made him instrument  Of mischief, and polluted from the end  Of his creation; justly then accursed,  As vitiated in nature: More to know  Concerned not Man, (since he no further knew)  Nor altered his offence; yet God at last  
Paradise Lost 
287 of 374 
To Satan first in sin his doom applied,  Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best:  And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.  Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed  Above all cattle, each beast of the field;  Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go,  And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life.  Between thee and the woman I will put  Enmity, and between thine and her seed;  Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.  So spake this oracle, then verified  When Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve,  Saw Satan fall, like lightning, down from Heaven,  Prince of the air; then, rising from his grave  Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed  In open show; and, with ascension bright,  Captivity led captive through the air,  The realm itself of Satan, long usurped;  Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;  Even he, who now foretold his fatal bruise;  And to the Woman thus his sentence turned.  Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply  By thy conception; children thou shalt bring  In sorrow forth; and to thy husbands will  Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule.  On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced.  Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife,  And eaten of the tree, concerning which  I charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof:  
Paradise Lost 
288 of 374 
Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow  Shalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life;  Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth  Unbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;  In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,  Till thou return unto the ground; for thou  Out of the ground wast taken, know thy birth,  For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return.  So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent;  And the instant stroke of death, denounced that day,  Removed far off; then, pitying how they stood  Before him naked to the air, that now  Must suffer change, disdained not to begin  Thenceforth the form of servant to assume;  As when he washed his servants feet; so now,  As father of his family, he clad  Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain,  Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid;  And thought not much to clothe his enemies;  Nor he their outward only with the skins  Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more.  Opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness,  Arraying, covered from his Fathers sight.  To him with swift ascent he up returned,  Into his blissful bosom reassumed  In glory, as of old; to him appeased  All, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man  Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.  Mean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth,  
Paradise Lost 
289 of 374 
Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death,  In counterview within the gates, that now  Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame  Far into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through,  Sin opening; who thus now to Death began.  O Son, why sit we here each other viewing  Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives  In other worlds, and happier seat provides  For us, his offspring dear? It cannot be  But that success attends him; if mishap,  Ere this he had returned, with fury driven  By his avengers; since no place like this  Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.  Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,  Wings growing, and dominion given me large  Beyond this deep; whatever draws me on,  Or sympathy, or some connatural force,  Powerful at greatest distance to unite,  With secret amity, things of like kind,  By secretest conveyance. Thou, my shade  Inseparable, must with me along;  For Death from Sin no power can separate.  But, lest the difficulty of passing back  Stay his return perhaps over this gulf  Impassable, impervious; let us try  Adventurous work, yet to thy power and mine  Not unagreeable, to found a path  Over this main from Hell to that new world,  Where Satan now prevails; a monument  
Paradise Lost 
290 of 374 
Of merit high to all the infernal host,  Easing their passage hence, for intercourse,  Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead.  Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn  By this new-felt attraction and instinct.  Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon.  Go, whither Fate, and inclination strong,  Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err  The way, thou leading; such a scent I draw  Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste  The savour of death from all things there that live:  Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest  Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.  So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell  Of mortal change on earth. As when a flock  Of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote,  Against the day of battle, to a field,  Where armies lie encamped, come flying, lured  With scent of living carcasses designed  For death, the following day, in bloody fight:  So scented the grim Feature, and upturned  His nostril wide into the murky air;  Sagacious of his quarry from so far.  Then both from out Hell-gates, into the waste  Wide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark,  Flew diverse; and with power (their power was great)  Hovering upon the waters, what they met  Solid or slimy, as in raging sea  Tost up and down, together crouded drove,  
Paradise Lost 
291 of 374 
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell;  As when two polar winds, blowing adverse  Upon the Cronian sea, together drive  Mountains of ice, that stop the imagined way  Beyond Petsora eastward, to the rich  Cathaian coast. The aggregated soil  Death with his mace petrifick, cold and dry,  As with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm  As Delos, floating once; the rest his look  Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move;  And with Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate,  Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach  They fastened, and the mole immense wrought on  Over the foaming deep high-arched, a bridge  Of length prodigious, joining to the wall  Immoveable of this now fenceless world,  Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,  Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell.  So, if great things to small may be compared,  Xerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke,  From Susa, his Memnonian palace high,  Came to the sea: and, over Hellespont  Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined,  And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves.  Now had they brought the work by wonderous art  Pontifical, a ridge of pendant rock,  Over the vexed abyss, following the track  Of Satan to the self-same place where he  First lighted from his wing, and landed safe  
Paradise Lost 
292 of 374 
From out of Chaos, to the outside bare  Of this round world: With pins of adamant  And chains they made all fast, too fast they made  And durable! And now in little space  The confines met of empyrean Heaven,  And of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell  With long reach interposed; three several ways  In sight, to each of these three places led.  And now their way to Earth they had descried,  To Paradise first tending; when, behold!  Satan, in likeness of an Angel bright,  Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering  His zenith, while the sun in Aries rose:  Disguised he came; but those his children dear  Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise.  He, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk  Into the wood fast by; and, changing shape,  To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act  By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded  Upon her husband; saw their shame that sought  Vain covertures; but when he saw descend  The Son of God to judge them, terrified  He fled; not hoping to escape, but shun  The present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath  Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned  By night, and listening where the hapless pair  Sat in their sad discourse, and various plaint,  Thence gathered his own doom; which understood  Not instant, but of future time, with joy  
Paradise Lost 
293 of 374 
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned;  And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot  Of this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped  Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear.  Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight  Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased.  Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair  Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke.  O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds,  Thy trophies! which thou viewest as not thine own;  Thou art their author, and prime architect:  For I no sooner in my heart divined,  My heart, which by a secret harmony  Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet,  That thou on earth hadst prospered, which thy looks  Now also evidence, but straight I felt,  Though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt,  That I must after thee, with this thy son;  Such fatal consequence unites us three!  Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds,  Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure  Detain from following thy illustrious track.  Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined  Within Hell-gates till now; thou us impowered  To fortify thus far, and overlay,  With this portentous bridge, the dark abyss.  Thine now is all this world; thy virtue hath won  What thy hands builded not; thy wisdom gained  With odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged  
Paradise Lost

Our foil in Heaven; here thou shalt monarch reign,  There didst not; there let him still victor sway,  As battle hath adjudged; from this new world  Retiring, by his own doom alienated;  And henceforth monarchy with thee divide  Of all things, parted by the empyreal bounds,  His quadrature, from thy orbicular world;  Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne.  Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad.  Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both;  High proof ye now have given to be the race  Of Satan (for I glory in the name,  Antagonist of Heavens Almighty King,)  Amply have merited of me, of all  The infernal empire, that so near Heavens door  Triumphal with triumphal act have met,  Mine, with this glorious work; and made one realm,  Hell and this world, one realm, one continent  Of easy thorough-fare. Therefore, while I  Descend through darkness, on your road with ease,  To my associate Powers, them to acquaint  With these successes, and with them rejoice;  You two this way, among these numerous orbs,  All yours, right down to Paradise descend;  There dwell, and reign in bliss; thence on the earth  Dominion exercise and in the air,  Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared;  Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.  My substitutes I send ye, and create  
Paradise Lost 
295 of 374 
Plenipotent on earth, of matchless might  Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now  My hold of this new kingdom all depends,  Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit.  If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell  No detriment need fear; go, and be strong!  So saying he dismissed them; they with speed  Their course through thickest constellations held,  Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan,  And planets, planet-struck, real eclipse  Then suffered. The other way Satan went down  The causey to Hell-gate: On either side  Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed,  And with rebounding surge the bars assailed,  That scorned his indignation: Through the gate,  Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed,  And all about found desolate; for those,  Appointed to sit there, had left their charge,  Flown to the upper world; the rest were all  Far to the inland retired, about the walls  Of Pandemonium; city and proud seat  Of Lucifer, so by allusion called  Of that bright star to Satan paragoned;  There kept their watch the legions, while the Grand  In council sat, solicitous what chance  Might intercept their emperour sent; so he  Departing gave command, and they observed.  As when the Tartar from his Russian foe,  By Astracan, over the snowy plains,  
Paradise Lost

Retires; or Bactrin Sophi, from the horns  Of Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond  The realm of Aladule, in his retreat  To Tauris or Casbeen: So these, the late  Heaven-banished host, left desart utmost Hell  Many a dark league, reduced in careful watch  Round their metropolis; and now expecting  Each hour their great adventurer, from the search  Of foreign worlds: He through the midst unmarked,  In show plebeian Angel militant  Of lowest order, passed; and from the door  Of that Plutonian hall, invisible  Ascended his high throne; which, under state  Of richest texture spread, at the upper end  Was placed in regal lustre. Down a while  He sat, and round about him saw unseen:  At last, as from a cloud, his fulgent head  And shape star-bright appeared, or brighter; clad  With what permissive glory since his fall  Was left him, or false glitter: All amazed  At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng  Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld,  Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim:  Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers,  Raised from their dark Divan, and with like joy  Congratulant approached him; who with hand  Silence, and with these words attention, won.  Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers;  For in possession such, not only of right,

I call ye, and declare ye now; returned  Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth  Triumphant out of this infernal pit  Abominable, accursed, the house of woe,  And dungeon of our tyrant: Now possess,  As Lords, a spacious world, to our native Heaven  Little inferiour, by my adventure hard  With peril great achieved. Long were to tell  What I have done; what suffered;with what pain  Voyaged th unreal, vast, unbounded deep  Of horrible confusion; over which  By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved,  To expedite your glorious march; but I  Toiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride  The untractable abyss, plunged in the womb  Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild;  That, jealous of their secrets, fiercely opposed  My journey strange, with clamorous uproar  Protesting Fate supreme; thence how I found  The new created world, which fame in Heaven  Long had foretold, a fabrick wonderful  Of absolute perfection! therein Man  Placed in a Paradise, by our exile  Made happy: Him by fraud I have seduced  From his Creator; and, the more to encrease  Your wonder, with an apple; he, thereat  Offended, worth your laughter! hath given up  Both his beloved Man, and all his world,  To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,  
Paradise Lost

Without our hazard, labour, or alarm;  To range in, and to dwell, and over Man  To rule, as over all he should have ruled.  True is, me also he hath judged, or rather  Me not, but the brute serpent in whose shape  Man I deceived: that which to me belongs,  Is enmity which he will put between  Me and mankind; I am to bruise his heel;  His seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:  A world who would not purchase with a bruise,  Or much more grievous pain?Ye have the account  Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods,  But up, and enter now into full bliss?  So having said, a while he stood, expecting  Their universal shout, and high applause,  To fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears  On all sides, from innumerable tongues,  A dismal universal hiss, the sound  Of publick scorn; he wondered, but not long  Had leisure, wondering at himself now more,  His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare;  His arms clung to his ribs; his legs entwining  Each other, till supplanted down he fell  A monstrous serpent on his belly prone,  Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power  Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned,  According to his doom: he would have spoke,  But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue  To forked tongue; for now were all transformed  
Paradise Lost 
299 of 374 
Alike, to serpents all, as accessories  To his bold riot: Dreadful was the din  Of hissing through the hall, thick swarming now  With complicated monsters head and tail,  Scorpion, and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire,  Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear,  And Dipsas; (not so thick swarmed once the soil  Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle  Ophiusa,) but still greatest he the midst,  Now Dragon grown, larger than whom the sun  Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime,  Huge Python, and his power no less he seemed  Above the rest still to retain; they all  Him followed, issuing forth to the open field,  Where all yet left of that revolted rout,  Heaven-fallen, in station stood or just array;  Sublime with expectation when to see  In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief;  They saw, but other sight instead! a croud  Of ugly serpents; horrour on them fell,  And horrid sympathy; for, what they saw,  They felt themselves, now changing; down their arms,  Down fell both spear and shield; down they as fast;  And the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form  Catched, by contagion; like in punishment,  As in their crime. Thus was the applause they meant,  Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame  Cast on themselves from their own mouths. There stood  A grove hard by, sprung up with this their change,  
Paradise Lost 
300 of 374 
His will who reigns above, to aggravate  Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that  Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve  Used by the Tempter: on that prospect strange  Their earnest eyes they fixed, imagining  For one forbidden tree a multitude  Now risen, to work them further woe or shame;  Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce,  Though to delude them sent, could not abstain;  But on they rolled in heaps, and, up the trees  Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks  That curled Megaera: greedily they plucked  The fruitage fair to sight, like that which grew  Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed;  This more delusive, not the touch, but taste  Deceived; they, fondly thinking to allay  Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit  Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste  With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed,  Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft,  With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws,  With soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell  Into the same illusion, not as Man  Whom they triumphed once lapsed. Thus were they plagued  And worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss,  Till their lost shape, permitted, they resumed;  Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo,  This annual humbling certain numbered days,  
Paradise Lost

To dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced.  However, some tradition they dispersed  Among the Heathen, of their purchase got,  And fabled how the Serpent, whom they called  Ophion, with Eurynome, the wide  Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule  Of high Olympus; thence by Saturn driven  And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born.  Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair  Too soon arrived; Sin, there in power before,  Once actual; now in body, and to dwell  Habitual habitant; behind her Death,  Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet  On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began.  Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death!  What thinkest thou of our empire now, though earned  With travel difficult, not better far  Than still at Hells dark threshold to have sat watch,  Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved?  Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon.  To me, who with eternal famine pine,  Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven;  There best, where most with ravine I may meet;  Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems  To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps.  To whom the incestuous mother thus replied.  Thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flowers,  Feed first; on each beast next, and fish, and fowl;  No homely morsels! and, whatever thing  
Paradise Lost

The sithe of Time mows down, devour unspared;  Till I, in Man residing, through the race,  His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect;  And season him thy last and sweetest prey.  This said, they both betook them several ways,  Both to destroy, or unimmortal make  All kinds, and for destruction to mature  Sooner or later; which the Almighty seeing,  From his transcendent seat the Saints among,  To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.  See, with what heat these dogs of Hell advance  To waste and havock yonder world, which I  So fair and good created; and had still  Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man  Let in these wasteful furies, who impute  Folly to me; so doth the Prince of Hell  And his adherents, that with so much ease  I suffer them to enter and possess  A place so heavenly; and, conniving, seem  To gratify my scornful enemies,  That laugh, as if, transported with some fit  Of passion, I to them had quitted all,  At random yielded up to their misrule;  And know not that I called, and drew them thither,  My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth  Which Mans polluting sin with taint hath shed  On what was pure; til, crammed and gorged, nigh burst  With sucked and glutted offal, at one sling  Of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son,  
Paradise Lost 
303 of 374 
Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave, at last,  Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell  For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws.  Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure  To sanctity, that shall receive no stain:  Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes.  He ended, and the heavenly audience loud  Sung Halleluiah, as the sound of seas,  Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,  Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works;  Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son,  Destined Restorer of mankind, by whom  New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise,  Or down from Heaven descend.Such was their song;  While the Creator, calling forth by name  His mighty Angels, gave them several charge,  As sorted best with present things. The sun  Had first his precept so to move, so shine,  As might affect the earth with cold and heat  Scarce tolerable; and from the north to call  Decrepit winter; from the south to bring  Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc moon  Her office they prescribed; to the other five  Their planetary motions, and aspects,  In sextile, square, and trine, and opposite,  Of noxious efficacy, and when to join  In synod unbenign; and taught the fixed  Their influence malignant when to shower,  Which of them rising with the sun, or falling,  
Paradise Lost 
304 of 374 
Should prove tempestuous: To the winds they set  Their corners, when with bluster to confound  Sea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll  With terrour through the dark aereal hall.  Some say, he bid his Angels turn ascanse  The poles of earth, twice ten degrees and more,  From the suns axle; they with labour pushed  Oblique the centrick globe: Some say, the sun  Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road  Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven  Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins,  Up to the Tropick Crab: thence down amain  By Leo, and the Virgin, and the Scales,  As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change  Of seasons to each clime; else had the spring  Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers,  Equal in days and nights, except to those  Beyond the polar circles; to them day  Had unbenighted shone, while the low sun,  To recompense his distance, in their sight  Had rounded still the horizon, and not known  Or east or west; which had forbid the snow  From cold Estotiland, and south as far  Beneath Magellan. At that tasted fruit  The sun, as from Thyestean banquet, turned  His course intended; else, how had the world  Inhabited, though sinless, more than now,  Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?  These changes in the Heavens, though slow, produced  
Paradise Lost 
305 of 374 
Like change on sea and land; sideral blast,  Vapour, and mist, and exhalation hot,  Corrupt and pestilent: Now from the north  Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shore,  Bursting their brazen dungeon, armed with ice,  And snow, and hail, and stormy gust and flaw,  Boreas, and Caecias, and Argestes loud,  And Thrascias, rend the woods, and seas upturn;  With adverse blast upturns them from the south  Notus, and Afer black with thunderous clouds  From Serraliona; thwart of these, as fierce,  Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds,  Eurus and Zephyr, with their lateral noise,  Sirocco and Libecchio. Thus began  Outrage from lifeless things; but Discord first,  Daughter of Sin, among the irrational  Death introduced, through fierce antipathy:  Beast now with beast gan war, and fowl with fowl,  And fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving,  Devoured each other; nor stood much in awe  Of Man, but fled him; or, with countenance grim,  Glared on him passing. These were from without  The growing miseries, which Adam saw  Already in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,  To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within;  And, in a troubled sea of passion tost,  Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint.  O miserable of happy! Is this the end  Of this new glorious world, and me so late  
Paradise Lost 
306 of 374 
The glory of that glory, who now become  Accursed, of blessed? hide me from the face  Of God, whom to behold was then my highth  Of happiness!Yet well, if here would end  The misery; I deserved it, and would bear  My own deservings; but this will not serve:  All that I eat or drink, or shall beget,  Is propagated curse. O voice, once heard  Delightfully, Encrease and multiply;  Now death to hear! for what can I encrease,  Or multiply, but curses on my head?  Who of all ages to succeed, but, feeling  The evil on him brought by me, will curse  My head? Ill fare our ancestor impure,  For this we may thank Adam! but his thanks  Shall be the execration: so, besides  Mine own that bide upon me, all from me  Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound;  On me, as on their natural center, light  Heavy, though in their place. O fleeting joys  Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes!  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay  To mould me Man? did I solicit thee  From darkness to promote me, or here place  In this delicious garden? As my will  Concurred not to my being, it were but right  And equal to reduce me to my dust;  Desirous to resign and render back  All I received; unable to perform  
Paradise Lost 
307 of 374 
Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold  The good I sought not. To the loss of that,  Sufficient penalty, why hast thou added  The sense of endless woes? Inexplicable  Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out  To deathless pain? How gladly would I meet  Mortality my sentence, and be earth  Insensible! How glad would lay me down  As in my mothers lap! There I should rest,  And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more  Would thunder in my ears; no fear of worse  To me, and to my offspring, would torment me  With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt  Pursues me still, lest all I cannot die;  Lest that pure breath of life, the spirit of Man  Which God inspired, cannot together perish  With this corporeal clod; then, in the grave,  Or in some other dismal place, who knows  But I shall die a living death? O thought  Horrid, if true! Yet why? It was but breath  Of life that sinned; what dies but what had life  And sin? The body properly had neither,  All of me then shall die: let this appease  The doubt, since human reach no further knows.  For though the Lord of all be infinite,  Is his wrath also? Be it, Man is not so,  But mortal doomed. How can he exercise  Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end?  Can he make deathless death? That were to make  
Paradise Lost 
308 of 374 
Strange contradiction, which to God himself  Impossible is held; as argument  Of weakness, not of power. Will he draw out,  For angers sake, finite to infinite,  In punished Man, to satisfy his rigour,  Satisfied never? That were to extend  His sentence beyond dust and Natures law;  By which all causes else, according still  To the reception of their matter, act;  Not to the extent of their own sphere. But say  That death be not one stroke, as I supposed,  Bereaving sense, but endless misery  From this day onward; which I feel begun  Both in me, and without me; and so last  To perpetuity;Ay me!that fear  Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution  On my defenceless head; both Death and I  Am found eternal, and incorporate both;  Nor I on my part single; in me all  Posterity stands cursed: Fair patrimony  That I must leave ye, Sons! O, were I able  To waste it all myself, and leave ye none!  So disinherited, how would you bless  Me, now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind,  For one mans fault, thus guiltless be condemned,  It guiltless? But from me what can proceed,  But all corrupt; both mind and will depraved  Not to do only, but to will the same  With me? How can they then acquitted stand  
Paradise Lost 
309 of 374 
In sight of God? Him, after all disputes,  Forced I absolve: all my evasions vain,  And reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still  But to my own conviction: first and last  On me, me only, as the source and spring  Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;  So might the wrath! Fond wish!couldst thou support  That burden, heavier than the earth to bear;  Than all the world much heavier, though divided  With that bad Woman? Thus, what thou desirest,  And what thou fearest, alike destroys all hope  Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable  Beyond all past example and future;  To Satan only like both crime and doom.  O Conscience! into what abyss of fears  And horrours hast thou driven me; out of which  I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged!  Thus Adam to himself lamented loud,  Through the still night; not now, as ere Man fell,  Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air  Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom;  Which to his evil conscience represented  All things with double terrour: On the ground  Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft  Cursed his creation; Death as oft accused  Of tardy execution, since denounced  The day of his offence. Why comes not Death,  Said he, with one thrice-acceptable stroke  To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word,  
Paradise Lost 
310 of 374 
Justice Divine not hasten to be just?  But Death comes not at call; Justice Divine  Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries,  O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers!  With other echo late I taught your shades  To answer, and resound far other song.  Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld,  Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh,  Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed:  But her with stern regard he thus repelled.  Out of my sight, thou Serpent! That name best  Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false  And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,  Like his, and colour serpentine, may show  Thy inward fraud; to warn all creatures from thee  Henceforth; lest that too heavenly form, pretended  To hellish falshood, snare them! But for thee  I had persisted happy; had not thy pride  And wandering vanity, when least was safe,  Rejected my forewarning, and disdained  Not to be trusted; longing to be seen,  Though by the Devil himself; him overweening  To over-reach; but, with the serpent meeting,  Fooled and beguiled; by him thou, I by thee  To trust thee from my side; imagined wise,  Constant, mature, proof against all assaults;  And understood not all was but a show,  Rather than solid virtue; all but a rib  Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,  
Paradise Lost 
311 of 374 
More to the part sinister, from me drawn;  Well if thrown out, as supernumerary  To my just number found. O! why did God,  Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven  With Spirits masculine, create at last  This novelty on earth, this fair defect  Of nature, and not fill the world at once  With Men, as Angels, without feminine;  Or find some other way to generate  Mankind? This mischief had not been befallen,  And more that shall befall; innumerable  Disturbances on earth through female snares,  And strait conjunction with this sex: for either  He never shall find out fit mate, but such  As some misfortune brings him, or mistake;  Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain  Through her perverseness, but shall see her gained  By a far worse; or, if she love, withheld  By parents; or his happiest choice too late  Shall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound  To a fell adversary, his hate or shame:  Which infinite calamity shall cause  To human life, and houshold peace confound.  He added not, and from her turned; but Eve,  Not so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing  And tresses all disordered, at his feet  Fell humble; and, embracing them, besought  His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.  Forsake me not thus, Adam! witness Heaven  
Paradise Lost 
312 of 374 
What love sincere, and reverence in my heart  I bear thee, and unweeting have offended,  Unhappily deceived! Thy suppliant  I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,  Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,  Thy counsel, in this uttermost distress,  My only strength and stay: Forlorn of thee,  Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?  While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps,  Between us two let there be peace; both joining,  As joined in injuries, one enmity  Against a foe by doom express assigned us,  That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not  Thy hatred for this misery befallen;  On me already lost, me than thyself  More miserable! Both have sinned;but thou  Against God only; I against God and thee;  And to the place of judgement will return,  There with my cries importune Heaven; that all  The sentence, from thy head removed, may light  On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe;  Me, me only, just object of his ire!  She ended weeping; and her lowly plight,  Immoveable, till peace obtained from fault  Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought  Commiseration: Soon his heart relented  Towards her, his life so late, and sole delight,  Now at his feet submissive in distress;  Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking,  
Paradise Lost 
313 of 374 
His counsel, whom she had displeased, his aid:  As one disarmed, his anger all he lost,  And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon.  Unwary, and too desirous, as before,  So now of what thou knowest not, who desirest  The punishment all on thyself; alas!  Bear thine own first, ill able to sustain  His full wrath, whose thou feelest as yet least part,  And my displeasure bearest so ill. If prayers  Could alter high decrees, I to that place  Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,  That on my head all might be visited;  Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven,  To me committed, and by me exposed.  But rise;let us no more contend, nor blame  Each other, blamed enough elsewhere; but strive  In offices of love, how we may lighten  Each others burden, in our share of woe;  Since this days death denounced, if aught I see,  Will prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil;  A long days dying, to augment our pain;  And to our seed (O hapless seed!) derived.  To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied.  Adam, by sad experiment I know  How little weight my words with thee can find,  Found so erroneous; thence by just event  Found so unfortunate: Nevertheless,  Restored by thee, vile as I am, to place  Of new acceptance, hopeful to regain  
Paradise Lost 
314 of 374 
Thy love, the sole contentment of my heart  Living or dying, from thee I will not hide  What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen,  Tending to some relief of our extremes,  Or end; though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,  As in our evils, and of easier choice.  If care of our descent perplex us most,  Which must be born to certain woe, devoured  By Death at last; and miserable it is  To be to others cause of misery,  Our own begotten, and of our loins to bring  Into this cursed world a woeful race,  That after wretched life must be at last  Food for so foul a monster; in thy power  It lies, yet ere conception to prevent  The race unblest, to being yet unbegot.  Childless thou art, childless remain: so Death  Shall be deceived his glut, and with us two  Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw.  But if thou judge it hard and difficult,  Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain  From loves due rights, nuptial embraces sweet;  And with desire to languish without hope,  Before the present object languishing  With like desire; which would be misery  And torment less than none of what we dread;  Then, both ourselves and seed at once to free  From what we fear for both, let us make short,   Let us seek Death;  or, he not found, supply  
Paradise Lost 
315 of 374 
With our own hands his office on ourselves:  Why stand we longer shivering under fears,  That show no end but death, and have the power,  Of many ways to die the shortest choosing,  Destruction with destruction to destroy?   She ended here, or vehement despair  Broke off the rest: so much of death her thoughts  Had entertained, as dyed her cheeks with pale.  But Adam, with such counsel nothing swayed,  To better hopes his more attentive mind  Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied.  Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems  To argue in thee something more sublime  And excellent, than what thy mind contemns;  But self-destruction therefore sought, refutes  That excellence thought in thee; and implies,  Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret  For loss of life and pleasure overloved.  Or if thou covet death, as utmost end  Of misery, so thinking to evade  The penalty pronounced; doubt not but God  Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire, than so  To be forestalled; much more I fear lest death,  So snatched, will not exempt us from the pain  We are by doom to pay; rather, such acts  Of contumacy will provoke the Highest  To make death in us live: Then let us seek  Some safer resolution, which methinks  I have in view, calling to mind with heed  
Paradise Lost 
316 of 374 
Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise  The Serpents head; piteous amends! unless  Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand foe,  Satan; who, in the serpent, hath contrived  Against us this deceit: To crush his head  Would be revenge indeed! which will be lost  By death brought on ourselves, or childless days  Resolved, as thou proposest; so our foe  Shal scape his punishment ordained, and we  Instead shall double ours upon our heads.  No more be mentioned then of violence  Against ourselves; and wilful barrenness,  That cuts us off from hope; and savours only  Rancour and pride, impatience and despite,  Reluctance against God and his just yoke  Laid on our necks. Remember with what mild  And gracious temper he both heard, and judged,  Without wrath or reviling; we expected  Immediate dissolution, which we thought  Was meant by death that day; when lo!to thee  Pains only in child-bearing were foretold,  And bringing forth; soon recompensed with joy,  Fruit of thy womb: On me the curse aslope  Glanced on the ground; with labour I must earn  My bread; what harm? Idleness had been worse;  My labour will sustain me; and, lest cold  Or heat should injure us, his timely care  Hath, unbesought, provided; and his hands  Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged;  
Paradise Lost 
317 of 374 
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear  Be open, and his heart to pity incline,  And teach us further by what means to shun  The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow!  Which now the sky, with various face, begins  To show us in this mountain; while the winds  Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks  Of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek  Some better shroud, some better warmth to cherish  Our limbs benummed, ere this diurnal star  Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams  Reflected may with matter sere foment;  Or, by collision of two bodies, grind  The air attrite to fire; as late the clouds  Justling, or pushed with winds, rude in their shock,  Tine the slant lightning; whose thwart flame, driven down  Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine;  And sends a comfortable heat from far,  Which might supply the sun: Such fire to use,  And what may else be remedy or cure  To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,  He will instruct us praying, and of grace  Beseeching him; so as we need not fear  To pass commodiously this life, sustained  By him with many comforts, till we end  In dust, our final rest and native home.  What better can we do, than, to the place  Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall  Before him reverent; and there confess  
Paradise Lost 
318 of 374 
Humbly our faults, and pardon beg; with tears  Watering the ground, and with our sighs the air  Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign  Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek

Book XI 
Undoubtedly he will relent, and turn  From his displeasure; in whose look serene,  When angry most he seemed and most severe,  What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone?  So spake our father penitent; nor Eve  Felt less remorse: they, forthwith to the place  Repairing where he judged them, prostrate fell  Before him reverent; and both confessed  Humbly their faults, and pardon begged; with tears  Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air  Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign  Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.  Thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood  Praying; for from the mercy-seat above  Prevenient grace descending had removed  The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh  Regenerate grow instead; that sighs now breathed  Unutterable; which the Spirit of prayer  Inspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight  Than loudest oratory: Yet their port  Not of mean suitors; nor important less  Seemed their petition, than when the ancient pair  In fables old, less ancient yet than these,  Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore  The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine  Of Themis stood devout. To Heaven their prayers  
Paradise Lost 
320 of 374 
Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds  Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed  Dimensionless through heavenly doors; then clad  With incense, where the golden altar fumed,  By their great intercessour, came in sight  Before the Fathers throne: them the glad Son  Presenting, thus to intercede began.  See$ Father, what first-fruits on earth are sprung  From thy implanted grace in Man; these sighs  And prayers, which in this golden censer mixed  With incense, I thy priest before thee bring;  Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed  Sown with contrition in his heart, than those  Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees  Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen  From innocence. Now therefore, bend thine ear  To supplication; hear his sighs, though mute;  Unskilful with what words to pray, let me  Interpret for him; me, his advocate  And propitiation; all his works on me,  Good, or not good, ingraft; my merit those  Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay.  Accept me; and, in me, from these receive  The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live  Before thee reconciled, at least his days  Numbered, though sad; till death, his doom, (which I  To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,)  To better life shall yield him: where with me  All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss;  
Paradise Lost

Made one with me, as I with thee am one.  To whom the Father, without cloud, serene.  All thy request for Man, accepted Son,  Obtain; all thy request was my decree:  But, longer in that Paradise to dwell,  The law I gave to Nature him forbids:  Those pure immortal elements, that know,  No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul,  Eject him, tainted now; and purge him off,  As a distemper, gross, to air as gross,  And mortal food; as may dispose him best  For dissolution wrought by sin, that first  Distempered all things, and of incorrupt  Corrupted. I, at first, with two fair gifts  Created him endowed; with happiness,  And immortality: that fondly lost,  This other served but to eternize woe;  Till I provided death: so death becomes  His final remedy; and, after life,  Tried in sharp tribulation, and refined  By faith and faithful works, to second life,  Waked in the renovation of the just,  Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed.  But let us call to synod all the Blest,  Through Heavens wide bounds: from them I will not hide  My judgements; how with mankind I proceed,  As how with peccant Angels late they saw,  And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed.

He ended, and the Son gave signal high  To the bright minister that watched; he blew  His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps  When God descended, and perhaps once more  To sound at general doom. The angelick blast  Filled all the regions: from their blisful bowers  Of amarantine shade, fountain or spring,  By the waters of life, whereer they sat  In fellowships of joy, the sons of light  Hasted, resorting to the summons high;  And took their seats; till from his throne supreme  The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will.  O Sons, like one of us Man is become  To know both good and evil, since his taste  Of that defended fruit; but let him boast  His knowledge of good lost, and evil got;  Happier! had it sufficed him to have known  Good by itself, and evil not at all.  He sorrows now, repents, and prays contrite,  My motions in him; longer than they move,  His heart I know, how variable and vain,  Self-left. Lest therefore his now bolder hand  Reach also of the tree of life, and eat,  And live for ever, dream at least to live  For ever, to remove him I decree,  And send him from the garden forth to till  The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil.  Michael, this my behest have thou in charge;  Take to thee from among the Cherubim

Thy choice of flaming warriours, lest the Fiend,  Or in behalf of Man, or to invade  Vacant possession, some new trouble raise:  Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God  Without remorse drive out the sinful pair;  From hallowed ground the unholy; and denounce  To them, and to their progeny, from thence  Perpetual banishment. Yet, lest they faint  At the sad sentence rigorously urged,  (For I behold them softened, and with tears  Bewailing their excess,) all terrour hide.  If patiently thy bidding they obey,  Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveal  To Adam what shall come in future days,  As I shall thee enlighten; intermix  My covenant in the Womans seed renewed;  So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:  And on the east side of the garden place,  Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs,  Cherubick watch; and of a sword the flame  Wide-waving; all approach far off to fright,  And guard all passage to the tree of life:  Lest Paradise a receptacle prove  To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey;  With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude.  He ceased; and the arch-angelick Power prepared  For swift descent; with him the cohort bright  Of watchful Cherubim: four faces each  Had, like a double Janus; all their shape

Spangled with eyes more numerous than those  Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drouse,  Charmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed  Of Hermes, or his opiate rod. Mean while,  To re-salute the world with sacred light,  Leucothea waked; and with fresh dews imbalmed  The earth; when Adam and first matron Eve  Had ended now their orisons, and found  Strength added from above; new hope to spring  Out of despair; joy, but with fear yet linked;  Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed.  Eve, easily my faith admit, that all  The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends;  But, that from us aught should ascend to Heaven  So prevalent as to concern the mind  Of God high-blest, or to incline his will,  Hard to belief may seem; yet this will prayer  Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne  Even to the seat of God. For since I sought  By prayer the offended Deity to appease;  Kneeled, and before him humbled all my heart;  Methought I saw him placable and mild,  Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew  That I was heard with favour; peace returned  Home to my breast, and to my memory  His promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe;  Which, then not minded in dismay, yet now  Assures me that the bitterness of death  Is past, and we shall live. Whence hail to thee,  
Paradise Lost

Eve rightly called, mother of all mankind,  Mother of all things living, since by thee  Man is to live; and all things live for Man.  To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.  Ill-worthy I such title should belong  To me transgressour; who, for thee ordained  A help, became thy snare; to me reproach  Rather belongs, distrust, and all dispraise:  But infinite in pardon was my Judge,  That I, who first brought death on all, am graced  The source of life; next favourable thou,  Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsafst,  Far other name deserving. But the field  To labour calls us, now with sweat imposed,  Though after sleepless night; for see!the morn,  All unconcerned with our unrest, begins  Her rosy progress smiling: let us forth;  I never from thy side henceforth to stray,  Whereer our days work lies, though now enjoined  Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,  What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?  Here let us live, though in fallen state, content.  So spake, so wished much humbled Eve; but Fate  Subscribed not: Nature first gave signs, impressed  On bird, beast, air; air suddenly eclipsed,  After short blush of morn; nigh in her sight  The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour,  Two birds of gayest plume before him drove;  Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods,

First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace,  Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind;  Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight.  Adam observed, and with his eye the chase  Pursuing, not unmoved, to Eve thus spake.  O Eve, some further change awaits us nigh,  Which Heaven, by these mute signs in Nature, shows  Forerunners of his purpose; or to warn  Us, haply too secure, of our discharge  From penalty, because from death released  Some days: how long, and what till then our life,  Who knows? or more than this, that we are dust,  And thither must return, and be no more?  Why else this double object in our sight  Of flight pursued in the air, and oer the ground,  One way the self-same hour? why in the east  Darkness ere days mid-course, and morning-light  More orient in yon western cloud, that draws  Oer the blue firmament a radiant white,  And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?  He erred not; for by this the heavenly bands  Down from a sky of jasper lighted now  In Paradise, and on a hill made halt;  A glorious apparition, had not doubt  And carnal fear that day dimmed Adams eye.  Not that more glorious, when the Angels met  Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw  The field pavilioned with his guardians bright;  Nor that, which on the flaming mount appeared

In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire,  Against the Syrian king, who to surprise  One man, assassin-like, had levied war,  War unproclaimed. The princely Hierarch  In their bright stand there left his Powers, to seise  Possession of the garden; he alone,  To find where Adam sheltered, took his way,  Not unperceived of Adam; who to Eve,  While the great visitant approached, thus spake.  Eve$ now expect great tidings, which perhaps  Of us will soon determine, or impose  New laws to be observed; for I descry,  From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill,  One of the heavenly host; and, by his gait,  None of the meanest; some great Potentate  Or of the Thrones above; such majesty  Invests him coming! yet not terrible,  That I should fear; nor sociably mild,  As Raphael, that I should much confide;  But solemn and sublime; whom not to offend,  With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.  He ended: and the Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,  Not in his shape celestial, but as man  Clad to meet man; over his lucid arms  A military vest of purple flowed,  Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain  Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old  In time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof;  His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime  
Paradise Lost

In manhood where youth ended; by his side,  As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword,  Satans dire dread; and in his hand the spear.  Adam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state  Inclined not, but his coming thus declared.  Adam, Heavens high behest no preface needs:  Sufficient that thy prayers are heard; and Death,  Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,  Defeated of his seisure many days  Given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent,  And one bad act with many deeds well done  Mayest cover: Well may then thy Lord, appeased,  Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claim;  But longer in this Paradise to dwell  Permits not: to remove thee I am come,  And send thee from the garden forth to till  The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil.  He added not; for Adam at the news  Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,  That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen  Yet all had heard, with audible lament  Discovered soon the place of her retire.  O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death!  Must I thus leave thee$ Paradise? thus leave  Thee, native soil! these happy walks and shades,  Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,  Quiet though sad, the respite of that day  That must be mortal to us both. O flowers,  That never will in other climate grow,

My early visitation, and my last  ;t even, which I bred up with tender hand  From the first opening bud, and gave ye names!  Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank  Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount?  Thee lastly, nuptial bower! by me adorned  With what to sight or smell was sweet! from thee  How shall I part, and whither wander down  Into a lower world; to this obscure  And wild? how shall we breathe in other air  Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?  Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild.  Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign  What justly thou hast lost, nor set thy heart,  Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine:  Thy going is not lonely; with thee goes  Thy husband; whom to follow thou art bound;  Where he abides, think there thy native soil.  Adam, by this from the cold sudden damp  Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned,  To Michael thus his humble words addressed.  Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named  Of them the highest; for such of shape may seem  Prince above princes! gently hast thou told  Thy message, which might else in telling wound,  And in performing end us; what besides  Of sorrow, and dejection, and despair,  Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring,  Departure from this happy place, our sweet  
Paradise Lost 
330 of 374 
Recess, and only consolation left  Familiar to our eyes! all places else  Inhospitable appear, and desolate;  Nor knowing us, nor known: And, if by prayer  Incessant I could hope to change the will  Of Him who all things can, I would not cease  To weary him with my assiduous cries:  But prayer against his absolute decree  No more avails than breath against the wind,  Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth:  Therefore to his great bidding I submit.  This most afflicts me, that, departing hence,  As from his face I shall be hid, deprived  His blessed countenance: Here I could frequent  With worship place by place where he vouchsafed  Presence Divine; and to my sons relate,  On this mount he appeared; under this tree  Stood visible; among these pines his voice  I heard; here with him at this fountain talked:  So many grateful altars I would rear  Of grassy turf, and pile up every stone  Of lustre from the brook, in memory,  Or monument to ages; and theron  Offer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers:  In yonder nether world where shall I seek  His bright appearances, or foot-step trace?  For though I fled him angry, yet recalled  To life prolonged and promised race, I now  Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts

Of glory; and far off his steps adore.  To whom thus Michael with regard benign.  Adam, thou knowest Heaven his, and all the Earth;  Not this rock only; his Omnipresence fills  Land, sea, and air, and every kind that lives,  Fomented by his virtual power and warmed:  All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule,  No despicable gift; surmise not then  His presence to these narrow bounds confined  Of Paradise, or Eden: this had been  Perhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread  All generations; and had hither come  From all the ends of the earth, to celebrate  And reverence thee, their great progenitor.  But this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down  To dwell on even ground now with thy sons:  Yet doubt not but in valley, and in plain,  God is, as here; and will be found alike  Present; and of his presence many a sign  Still following thee, still compassing thee round  With goodness and paternal love, his face  Express, and of his steps the track divine.  Which that thou mayest believe, and be confirmed  Ere thou from hence depart; know, I am sent  To show thee what shall come in future days  To thee, and to thy offspring: good with bad  Expect to hear; supernal grace contending  With sinfulness of men; thereby to learn  True patience, and to temper joy with fear

And pious sorrow; equally inured  By moderation either state to bear,  Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead  Safest thy life, and best prepared endure  Thy mortal passage when it comes.Ascend  This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes)  Here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest;  As once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed.  To whom thus Adam gratefully replied.  Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path  Thou leadest me; and to the hand of Heaven submit,  However chastening; to the evil turn  My obvious breast; arming to overcome  By suffering, and earn rest from labour won,  If so I may attain.  So both ascend  In the visions of God. It was a hill,  Of Paradise the highest; from whose top  The hemisphere of earth, in clearest ken,  Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay.  Not higher that hill, nor wider looking round,  Whereon, for different cause, the Tempter set  Our second Adam, in the wilderness;  To show him all Earths kingdoms, and their glory.  His eye might there command wherever stood  City of old or modern fame, the seat  Of mightiest empire, from the destined walls  Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can,  And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs throne,  To Paquin of Sinaean kings; and thence  
Paradise Lost 
333 of 374 
To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul,  Down to the golden Chersonese; or where  The Persian in Ecbatan sat, or since  In Hispahan; or where the Russian Ksar  In Mosco; or the Sultan in Bizance,  Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken  The empire of Negus to his utmost port  Ercoco, and the less maritim kings  Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,  And Sofala, thought Ophir, to the realm  Of Congo, and Angola farthest south;  Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount  The kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus,  Morocco, and Algiers, and Tremisen;  On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway  The world: in spirit perhaps he also saw  Rich Mexico, the seat of Montezume,  And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat  Of Atabalipa; and yet unspoiled  Guiana, whose great city Geryons sons  Call El Dorado. But to nobler sights  Michael from Adams eyes the film removed,  Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight  Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue  The visual nerve, for he had much to see;  And from the well of life three drops instilled.  So deep the power of these ingredients pierced,  Even to the inmost seat of mental sight,  That Adam, now enforced to close his eyes,  
Paradise Lost 
334 of 374 
Sunk down, and all his spirits became entranced;  But him the gentle Angel by the hand  Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled.  Adam, now ope thine eyes; and first behold  The effects, which thy original crime hath wrought  In some to spring from thee; who never touched  The excepted tree; nor with the snake conspired;  Nor sinned thy sin; yet from that sin derive  Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds.  His eyes he opened, and beheld a field,  Part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves  New reaped; the other part sheep-walks and folds;  I the midst an altar as the land-mark stood,  Rustick, of grassy sord; thither anon  A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought  First fruits, the green ear, and the yellow sheaf,  Unculled, as came to hand; a shepherd next,  More meek, came with the firstlings of his flock,  Choicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid  The inwards and their fat, with incense strowed,  On the cleft wood, and all due rights performed:  His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven  Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam;  The others not, for his was not sincere;  Whereat he inly raged, and, as they talked,  Smote him into the midriff with a stone  That beat out life; he fell;and, deadly pale,  Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused.  Much at that sight was Adam in his heart  
Paradise Lost 
335 of 374 
Dismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried.  O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen  To that meek man, who well had sacrificed;  Is piety thus and pure devotion paid?  To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied.  These two are brethren, Adam, and to come  Out of thy loins; the unjust the just hath slain,  For envy that his brothers offering found  From Heaven acceptance; but the bloody fact  Will be avenged; and the others faith, approved,  Lose no reward; though here thou see him die,  Rolling in dust and gore. To which our sire.  Alas! both for the deed, and for the cause!  But have I now seen Death? Is this the way  I must return to native dust? O sight  Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,  Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!  To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen  In his first shape on Man; but many shapes  Of Death, and many are the ways that lead  To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense  More terrible at the entrance, than within.  Some, as thou sawest, by violent stroke shall die;  By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more  In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring  Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew  Before thee shall appear; that thou mayest know  What misery the inabstinence of Eve  Shall bring on Men. Immediately a place  
Paradise Lost 
336 of 374 
Before his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark;  A lazar-house it seemed; wherein were laid  Numbers of all diseased; all maladies  Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms  Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds,  Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,  Intestine stone and ulcer, colick-pangs,  Demoniack phrenzy, moaping melancholy,  And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,  Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence,  Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums.  Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair  Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch;  And over them triumphant Death his dart  Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked  With vows, as their chief good, and final hope.  Sight so deform what heart of rock could long  Dry-eyed behold? Adam could not, but wept,  Though not of woman born; compassion quelled  His best of man, and gave him up to tears  A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess;  And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed.  O miserable mankind, to what fall  Degraded, to what wretched state reserved!  Better end here unborn. Why is life given  To be thus wrested from us? rather, why  Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew  What we receive, would either no accept  Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down;  
Paradise Lost 
337 of 374 
Glad to be so dismissed in peace. Can thus  The image of God in Man, created once  So goodly and erect, though faulty since,  To such unsightly sufferings be debased  Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man,  Retaining still divine similitude  In part, from such deformities be free,  And, for his Makers image sake, exempt?  Their Makers image, answered Michael, then  Forsook them, when themselves they vilified  To serve ungoverned Appetite; and took  His image whom they served, a brutish vice,  Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.  Therefore so abject is their punishment,  Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but their own;  Or if his likeness, by themselves defaced;  While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules  To loathsome sickness; worthily, since they  Gods image did not reverence in themselves.  I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.  But is there yet no other way, besides  These painful passages, how we may come  To death, and mix with our connatural dust?  There is, said Michael, if thou well observe  The rule of Not too much; by temperance taught,  In what thou eatest and drinkest; seeking from thence  Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,  Till many years over thy head return:  So mayest thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop  
Paradise Lost 
338 of 374 
Into thy mothers lap; or be with ease  Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature:  This is Old Age; but then, thou must outlive  Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty; which will change  To withered, weak, and gray; thy senses then,  Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forego,  To what thou hast; and, for the air of youth,  Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign  A melancholy damp of cold and dry  To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume  The balm of life. To whom our ancestor.  Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong  Life much; bent rather, how I may be quit,  Fairest and easiest, of this cumbrous charge;  Which I must keep till my appointed day  Of rendering up, and patiently attend  My dissolution. Michael replied.  Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest  Live well; how long, or short, permit to Heaven:  And now prepare thee for another sight.  He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon  Were tents of various hue; by some, were herds  Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound  Of instruments, that made melodious chime,  Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved  Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch,  Instinct through all proportions, low and high,  Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.  In other part stood one who, at the forge  
Paradise Lost 
339 of 374 
Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass  Had melted, (whether found where casual fire  Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale,  Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot  To some caves mouth; or whether washed by stream  From underground;) the liquid ore he drained  Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed  First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought  Fusil or graven in metal. After these,  But on the hither side, a different sort  From the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat,  Down to the plain descended; by their guise  Just men they seemed, and all their study bent  To worship God aright, and know his works  Not hid; nor those things last, which might preserve  Freedom and peace to Men; they on the plain  Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold!  A bevy of fair women, richly gay  In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung  Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on:  The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes  Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net  Fast caught, they liked; and each his liking chose;  And now of love they treat, till the evening-star,  Loves harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat  They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke  Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked:  With feast and musick all the tents resound.  Such happy interview, and fair event  
Paradise Lost 
340 of 374 
Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers,  And charming symphonies, attached the heart  Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight,  The bent of nature; which he thus expressed.  True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest;  Much better seems this vision, and more hope  Of peaceful days portends, than those two past;  Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse;  Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends.  To whom thus Michael. Judge not what is best  By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet;  Created, as thou art, to nobler end  Holy and pure, conformity divine.  Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents  Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race  Who slew his brother; studious they appear  Of arts that polish life, inventers rare;  Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit  Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none.  Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget;  For that fair female troop thou sawest, that seemed  Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,  Yet empty of all good wherein consists  Womans domestick honour and chief praise;  Bred only and completed to the taste  Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,  To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye:  To these that sober race of men, whose lives  Religious titled them the sons of God,  
Paradise Lost 
341 of 374 
Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame  Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles  Of these fair atheists; and now swim in joy,  Erelong to swim at large; and laugh, for which  The world erelong a world of tears must weep.  To whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft.  O pity and shame, that they, who to live well  Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread  Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!  But still I see the tenour of Mans woe  Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.  From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,  Said the Angel, who should better hold his place  By wisdom, and superiour gifts received.  But now prepare thee for another scene.  He looked, and saw wide territory spread  Before him, towns, and rural works between;  Cities of men with lofty gates and towers,  Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war,  Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise;  Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed,  Single or in array of battle ranged  Both horse and foot, nor idly mustering stood;  One way a band select from forage drives  A herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine,  From a fat meadow ground; or fleecy flock,  Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain,  Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly,  But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray;  
Paradise Lost 
342 of 374 
With cruel tournament the squadrons join;  Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies  With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field,  Deserted: Others to a city strong  Lay siege, encamped; by battery, scale, and mine,  Assaulting; others from the wall defend  With dart and javelin, stones, and sulphurous fire;  On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds.  In other part the sceptered heralds call  To council, in the city-gates; anon  Gray-headed men and grave, with warriours mixed,  Assemble, and harangues are heard; but soon,  In factious opposition; till at last,  Of middle age one rising, eminent  In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong,  Of justice, or religion, truth, and peace,  And judgement from above: him old and young  Exploded, and had seized with violent hands,  Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence  Unseen amid the throng: so violence  Proceeded, and oppression, and sword-law,  Through all the plain, and refuge none was found.  Adam was all in tears, and to his guide  Lamenting turned full sad; O!what are these,  Deaths ministers, not men? who thus deal death  Inhumanly to men, and multiply  Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew  His brother: for of whom such massacre  Make they, but of their brethren; men of men  
Paradise Lost 
343 of 374 
But who was that just man, whom had not Heaven  Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost?  To whom thus Michael. These are the product  Of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest;  Where good with bad were matched, who of themselves  Abhor to join; and, by imprudence mixed,  Produce prodigious births of body or mind.  Such were these giants, men of high renown;  For in those days might only shall be admired,  And valour and heroick virtue called;  To overcome in battle, and subdue  Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite  Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch  Of human glory; and for glory done  Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours  Patrons of mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods;  Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men.  Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth;  And what most merits fame, in silence hid.  But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst  The only righteous in a world preverse,  And therefore hated, therefore so beset  With foes, for daring single to be just,  And utter odious truth, that God would come  To judge them with his Saints; him the Most High  Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds  Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God  High in salvation and the climes of bliss,  Exempt from death; to show thee what reward  
Paradise Lost 
344 of 374 
Awaits the good; the rest what punishment;  Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.  He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed;  The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar;  All now was turned to jollity and game,  To luxury and riot, feast and dance;  Marrying or prostituting, as befel,  Rape or adultery, where passing fair  Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils.  At length a reverend sire among them came,  And of their doings great dislike declared,  And testified against their ways; he oft  Frequented their assemblies, whereso met,  Triumphs or festivals; and to them preached  Conversion and repentance, as to souls  In prison, under judgements imminent:  But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased  Contending, and removed his tents far off;  Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall,  Began to build a vessel of huge bulk;  Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth;  Smeared round with pitch; and in the side a door  Contrived; and of provisions laid in large,  For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange!  Of every beast, and bird, and insect small,  Came sevens, and pairs; and entered in as taught  Their order: last the sire and his three sons,  With their four wives; and God made fast the door.  Mean while the south-wind rose, and, with black wings  
Paradise Lost

Wide-hovering, all the clouds together drove  From under Heaven; the hills to their supply  Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist,  Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky  Like a dark cieling stood; down rushed the rain  Impetuous; and continued, till the earth  No more was seen: the floating vessel swum  Uplifted, and secure with beaked prow  Rode tilting oer the waves; all dwellings else  Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp  Deep under water rolled; sea covered sea,  Sea without shore; and in their palaces,  Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped  And stabled; of mankind, so numerous late,  All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked.  How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold  The end of all thy offspring, end so sad,  Depopulation! Thee another flood,  Of tears and sorrow a flood, thee also drowned,  And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared  By the Angel, on thy feet thou stoodest at last,  Though comfortless; as when a father mourns  His children, all in view destroyed at once;  And scarce to the Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.  O visions ill foreseen! Better had I  Lived ignorant of future! so had borne  My part of evil only, each days lot  Enough to bear; those now, that were dispensed  The burden of many ages, on me light  
Paradise Lost 
346 of 374 
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth  Abortive, to torment me ere their being,  With thought that they must be. Let no man seek  Henceforth to be foretold, what shall befall  Him or his children; evil he may be sure,  Which neither his foreknowing can prevent;  And he the future evil shall no less  In apprehension than in substance feel,  Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,  Man is not whom to warn: those few escaped  Famine and anguish will at last consume,  Wandering that watery desart: I had hope,  When violence was ceased, and war on earth,  All would have then gone well; peace would have crowned  With length of happy days the race of Man;  But I was far deceived; for now I see  Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste.  How comes it thus? unfold, celestial Guide,  And whether here the race of Man will end.  To whom thus Michael. Those, whom last thou sawest  In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they  First seen in acts of prowess eminent  And great exploits, but of true virtue void;  Who, having spilt much blood, and done much wast  Subduing nations, and achieved thereby  Fame in the world, high titles, and rich prey;  Shall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,  Surfeit, and lust; till wantonness and pride  
Paradise Lost 
347 of 374 
Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace.  The conquered also, and enslaved by war,  Shall, with their freedom lost, all virtue lose  And fear of God; from whom their piety feigned  In sharp contest of battle found no aid  Against invaders; therefore, cooled in zeal,  Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,  Worldly or dissolute, on what their lords  Shall leave them to enjoy; for the earth shall bear  More than enough, that temperance may be tried:  So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved;  Justice and temperance, truth and faith, forgot;  One man except, the only son of light  In a dark age, against example good,  Against allurement, custom, and a world  Offended: fearless of reproach and scorn,  The grand-child, with twelve sons encreased, departs  From Canaan, to a land hereafter called  Egypt, divided by the river Nile;  See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths  Into the sea: To sojourn in that land  He comes, invited by a younger son  In time of dearth; a son, whose worthy deeds  Raise him to be the second in that realm  Of Pharaoh: There he dies, and leaves his race  Growing into a nation, and now grown  Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks  To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests  Or violence, he of their wicked ways  
Paradise Lost 
348 of 374 
Shall them admonish; and before them set  The paths of righteousness, how much more safe  And full of peace; denouncing wrath to come  On their impenitence; and shall return  Of them derided, but of God observed  The one just man alive; by his command  Shall build a wonderous ark, as thou beheldst,  To save himself, and houshold, from amidst  A world devote to universal wrack.  No sooner he, with them of man and beast  Select for life, shall in the ark be lodged,  And sheltered round; but all the cataracts  Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour  Rain, day and night; all fountains of the deep,  Broke up, shall heave the ocean to usurp  Beyond all bounds; till inundation rise  Above the highest hills: Then shall this mount  Of Paradise by might of waves be moved  Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood,  With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift,  Down the great river to the opening gulf,  And there take root an island salt and bare,  The haunt of seals, and orcs, and sea-mews clang:  To teach thee that God attributes to place  No sanctity, if none be thither brought  By men who there frequent, or therein dwell.  And now, what further shall ensue, behold.  He looked, and saw the ark hull on the flood,  Which now abated; for the clouds were fled,  
Paradise Lost 
349 of 374 
Driven by a keen north-wind, that, blowing dry,  Wrinkled the face of deluge, as decayed;  And the clear sun on his wide watery glass  Gazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew,  As after thirst; which made their flowing shrink  From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole  With soft foot towards the deep; who now had stopt  His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut.  The ark no more now floats, but seems on ground,  Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed.  And now the tops of hills, as rocks, appear;  With clamour thence the rapid currents drive,  Towards the retreating sea, their furious tide.  Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies,  And after him, the surer messenger,  A dove sent forth once and again to spy  Green tree or ground, whereon his foot may light:  The second time returning, in his bill  An olive-leaf he brings, pacifick sign:  Anon dry ground appears, and from his ark  The ancient sire descends, with all his train;  Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,  Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds  A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow  Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,  Betokening peace from God, and covenant new.  Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad,  Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth.  O thou, who future things canst represent  
Paradise Lost 
350 of 374 
As present, heavenly Instructer! I revive  At this last sight; assured that Man shall live,  With all the creatures, and their seed preserve.  Far less I now lament for one whole world  Of wicked sons destroyed, than I rejoice  For one man found so perfect, and so just,  That God vouchsafes to raise another world  From him, and all his anger to forget.  But say, what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven  Distended, as the brow of God appeased?  Or serve they, as a flowery verge, to bind  The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud,  Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth?  To whom the Arch-Angel. Dextrously thou aimest;  So willingly doth God remit his ire,  Though late repenting him of Man depraved;  Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw  The whole earth filled with violence, and all flesh  Corrupting each their way; yet, those removed,  Such grace shall one just man find in his sight,  That he relents, not to blot out mankind;  And makes a covenant never to destroy  The earth again by flood; nor let the sea  Surpass his bounds; nor rain to drown the world,  With man therein or beast; but, when he brings  Over the earth a cloud, will therein set  His triple-coloured bow, whereon to look,  And call to mind his covenant: Day and night,  Seed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost,  
Paradise Lost 
351 of 374 
Shall hold their course; till fire purge all things new,  Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.

Book XII  
As one who in his journey bates at noon,  Though bent on speed; so here the Arch-Angel paused  Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored,  If Adam aught perhaps might interpose;  Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes.  Thus thou hast seen one world begin, and end;  And Man, as from a second stock, proceed.  Much thou hast yet to see; but I perceive  Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine  Must needs impair and weary human sense:  Henceforth what is to come I will relate;  Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.  This second source of Men, while yet but few,  And while the dread of judgement past remains  Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity,  With some regard to what is just and right  Shall lead their lives, and multiply apace;  Labouring the soil, and reaping plenteous crop,  Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock,  Oft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid,  With large wine-offerings poured, and sacred feast,  Shall spend their days in joy unblamed; and dwell  Long time in peace, by families and tribes,  Under paternal rule: till one shall rise  Of proud ambitious heart; who, not content  With fair equality, fraternal state,  
Paradise Lost 
353 of 374 
Will arrogate dominion undeserved  Over his brethren, and quite dispossess  Concord and law of nature from the earth;  Hunting (and men not beasts shall be his game)  With war, and hostile snare, such as refuse  Subjection to his empire tyrannous:  A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled  Before the Lord; as in despite of Heaven,  Or from Heaven, claiming second sovranty;  And from rebellion shall derive his name,  Though of rebellion others he accuse.  He with a crew, whom like ambition joins  With him or under him to tyrannize,  Marching from Eden towards the west, shall find  The plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge  Boils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell:  Of brick, and of that stuff, they cast to build  A city and tower, whose top may reach to Heaven;  And get themselves a name; lest, far dispersed  In foreign lands, their memory be lost;  Regardless whether good or evil fame.  But God, who oft descends to visit men  Unseen, and through their habitations walks  To mark their doings, them beholding soon,  Comes down to see their city, ere the tower  Obstruct Heaven-towers, and in derision sets  Upon their tongues a various spirit, to rase  Quite out their native language; and, instead,  To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:  
Paradise Lost 
354 of 374 
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud,  Among the builders; each to other calls  Not understood; till hoarse, and all in rage,  As mocked they storm: great laughter was in Heaven,  And looking down, to see the hubbub strange,  And hear the din: Thus was the building left  Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named.  Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased.  O execrable son! so to aspire  Above his brethren; to himself assuming  Authority usurped, from God not given:  He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,  Dominion absolute; that right we hold  By his donation; but man over men  He made not lord; such title to himself  Reserving, human left from human free.  But this usurper his encroachment proud  Stays not on Man; to God his tower intends  Siege and defiance: Wretched man!what food  Will he convey up thither, to sustain  Himself and his rash army; where thin air  Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross,  And famish him of breath, if not of bread?  To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorrest  That son, who on the quiet state of men  Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue  Rational liberty; yet know withal,  Since thy original lapse, true liberty  Is lost, which always with right reason dwells  
Paradise Lost 
355 of 374 
Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being:  Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed,  Immediately inordinate desires,  And upstart passions, catch the government  From reason; and to servitude reduce  Man, till then free. Therefore, since he permits  Within himself unworthy powers to reign  Over free reason, God, in judgement just,  Subjects him from without to violent lords;  Who oft as undeservedly enthrall  His outward freedom: Tyranny must be;  Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse.  Yet sometimes nations will decline so low  From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong,  But justice, and some fatal curse annexed,  Deprives them of their outward liberty;  Their inward lost: Witness the irreverent son  Of him who built the ark; who, for the shame  Done to his father, heard this heavy curse,  Servant of servants, on his vicious race.  Thus will this latter, as the former world,  Still tend from bad to worse; till God at last,  Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw  His presence from among them, and avert  His holy eyes; resolving from thenceforth  To leave them to their own polluted ways;  And one peculiar nation to select  From all the rest, of whom to be invoked,  A nation from one faithful man to spring:  
Paradise Lost 
356 of 374 
Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,  Bred up in idol-worship: O, that men  (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,  While yet the patriarch lived, who scaped the flood,  As to forsake the living God, and fall  To worship their own work in wood and stone  For Gods! Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes  To call by vision, from his fathers house,  His kindred, and false Gods, into a land  Which he will show him; and from him will raise  A mighty nation; and upon him shower  His benediction so, that in his seed  All nations shall be blest: he straight obeys;  Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes:  I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith  He leaves his Gods, his friends, and native soil,  Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the ford  To Haran; after him a cumbrous train  Of herds and flocks, and numerous servitude;  Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth  With God, who called him, in a land unknown.  Canaan he now attains; I see his tents  Pitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring plain  Of Moreh; there by promise he receives  Gift to his progeny of all that land,  From Hameth northward to the Desart south;  (Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed;)  From Hermon east to the great western Sea;  Mount Hermon, yonder sea; each place behold  
Paradise Lost 
357 of 374 
In prospect, as I point them; on the shore  Mount Carmel; here, the double-founted stream,  Jordan, true limit eastward; but his sons  Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills.  This ponder, that all nations of the earth  Shall in his seed be blessed: By that seed  Is meant thy great Deliverer, who shall bruise  The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon  Plainlier shall be revealed. This patriarch blest,  Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,  A son, and of his son a grand-child, leaves;  Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown:  The grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs  From Canaan to a land hereafter called  Egypt, divided by the river Nile  See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths  Into the sea. To sojourn in that land  He comes, invited by a younger son  In time of dearth, a son whose worthy deeds  Raise him to be the second in that realm  Of Pharaoh. There he dies, and leaves his race  Growing into a nation, and now grown  Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks  To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests  Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves  Inhospitably, and kills their infant males:  Till by two brethren (these two brethren call  Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim  His people from enthralment, they return,  
Paradise Lost 
358 of 374 
With glory and spoil, back to their promised land.  But first, the lawless tyrant, who denies  To know their God, or message to regard,  Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire;  To blood unshed the rivers must be turned;  Frogs, lice, and flies, must all his palace fill  With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land;  His cattle must of rot and murren die;  Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss,  And all his people; thunder mixed with hail,  Hail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptians sky,  And wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls;  What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain,  A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down  Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green;  Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,  Palpable darkness, and blot out three days;  Last, with one midnight stroke, all the first-born  Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds  The river-dragon tamed at length submits  To let his sojourners depart, and oft  Humbles his stubborn heart; but still, as ice  More hardened after thaw; till, in his rage  Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea  Swallows him with his host; but them lets pass,  As on dry land, between two crystal walls;  Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand  Divided, till his rescued gain their shore:  Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend,  
Paradise Lost 
359 of 374 
Though present in his Angel; who shall go  Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire;  By day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire;  To guide them in their journey, and remove  Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues:  All night he will pursue; but his approach  Darkness defends between till morning watch;  Then through the fiery pillar, and the cloud,  God looking forth will trouble all his host,  And craze their chariot-wheels: when by command  Moses once more his potent rod extends  Over the sea; the sea his rod obeys;  On their embattled ranks the waves return,  And overwhelm their war: The race elect  Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance  Through the wild Desart, not the readiest way;  Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed,  War terrify them inexpert, and fear  Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather  Inglorious life with servitude; for life  To noble and ignoble is more sweet  Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on.  This also shall they gain by their delay  In the wide wilderness; there they shall found  Their government, and their great senate choose  Through the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained:  God from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top  Shall tremble, he descending, will himself  In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets sound,  
Paradise Lost 
360 of 374 
Ordain them laws; part, such as appertain  To civil justice; part, religious rites  Of sacrifice; informing them, by types  And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise  The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve  Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God  To mortal ear is dreadful: They beseech  That Moses might report to them his will,  And terrour cease; he grants what they besought,  Instructed that to God is no access  Without Mediator, whose high office now  Moses in figure bears; to introduce  One greater, of whose day he shall foretel,  And all the Prophets in their age the times  Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus, laws and rites  Established, such delight hath God in Men  Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafes  Among them to set up his tabernacle;  The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell:  By his prescript a sanctuary is framed  Of cedar, overlaid with gold; therein  An ark, and in the ark his testimony,  The records of his covenant; over these  A mercy-seat of gold, between the wings  Of two bright Cherubim; before him burn  Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing  The heavenly fires; over the tent a cloud  Shall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night;  Save when they journey, and at length they come,  
Paradise Lost 
361 of 374 
Conducted by his Angel, to the land  Promised to Abraham and his seed:The rest  Were long to tell; how many battles fought  How many kings destroyed; and kingdoms won;  Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still  A day entire, and nights due course adjourn,  Mans voice commanding, Sun, in Gibeon stand,  And thou moon in the vale of Aialon,  Till Israel overcome! so call the third  From Abraham, son of Isaac; and from him  His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.  Here Adam interposed. O sent from Heaven,  Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things  Thou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern  Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find  Mine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased;  Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become  Of me and all mankind: But now I see  His day, in whom all nations shall be blest;  Favour unmerited by me, who sought  Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.  This yet I apprehend not, why to those  Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth  So many and so various laws are given;  So many laws argue so many sins  Among them; how can God with such reside?  To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin  Will reign among them, as of thee begot;  And therefore was law given them, to evince  
Paradise Lost 
362 of 374 
Their natural pravity, by stirring up  Sin against law to fight: that when they see  Law can discover sin, but not remove,  Save by those shadowy expiations weak,  The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude  Some blood more precious must be paid for Man;  Just for unjust; that, in such righteousness  To them by faith imputed, they may find  Justification towards God, and peace  Of conscience; which the law by ceremonies  Cannot appease; nor Man the mortal part  Perform; and, not performing, cannot live.  So law appears imperfect; and but given  With purpose to resign them, in full time,  Up to a better covenant; disciplined  From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit;  From imposition of strict laws to free  Acceptance of large grace; from servile fear  To filial; works of law to works of faith.  And therefore shall not Moses, though of God  Highly beloved, being but the minister  Of law, his people into Canaan lead;  But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call,  His name and office bearing, who shall quell  The adversary-Serpent, and bring back  Through the worlds wilderness long-wandered Man  Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.  Mean while they, in their earthly Canaan placed,  Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins  
Paradise Lost 
363 of 374 
National interrupt their publick peace,  Provoking God to raise them enemies;  From whom as oft he saves them penitent  By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom  The second, both for piety renowned  And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive  Irrevocable, that his regal throne  For ever shall endure; the like shall sing  All Prophecy, that of the royal stock  Of David (so I name this king) shall rise  A Son, the Womans seed to thee foretold,  Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust  All nations; and to kings foretold, of kings  The last; for of his reign shall be no end.  But first, a long succession must ensue;  And his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed,  The clouded ark of God, till then in tents  Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine.  Such follow him, as shall be registered  Part good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll;  Whose foul idolatries, and other faults  Heaped to the popular sum, will so incense  God, as to leave them, and expose their land,  Their city, his temple, and his holy ark,  With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey  To that proud city, whose high walls thou sawest  Left in confusion; Babylon thence called.  There in captivity he lets them dwell  The space of seventy years; then brings them back,  
Paradise Lost 
364 of 374 
Remembering mercy, and his covenant sworn  To David, stablished as the days of Heaven.  Returned from Babylon by leave of kings  Their lords, whom God disposed, the house of God  They first re-edify; and for a while  In mean estate live moderate; till, grown  In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;  But first among the priests dissention springs,  Men who attend the altar, and should most  Endeavour peace: their strife pollution brings  Upon the temple itself: at last they seise  The scepter, and regard not Davids sons;  Then lose it to a stranger, that the true  Anointed King Messiah might be born  Barred of his right; yet at his birth a star,  Unseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come;  And guides the eastern sages, who inquire  His place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold:  His place of birth a solemn Angel tells  To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night;  They gladly thither haste, and by a quire  Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.  A virgin is his mother, but his sire  The power of the Most High: He shall ascend  The throne hereditary, and bound his reign  With Earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.  He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy  Surcharged, as had like grief been dewed in tears,  Without the vent of words; which these he breathed.  
Paradise Lost 
365 of 374 
O prophet of glad tidings, finisher  Of utmost hope! now clear I understand  What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain;  Why our great Expectation should be called  The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, hail,  High in the love of Heaven; yet from my loins  Thou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son  Of God Most High: so God with Man unites!  Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise  Expect with mortal pain: Say where and when  Their fight, what stroke shall bruise the victors heel.  To whom thus Michael. Dream not of their fight,  As of a duel, or the local wounds  Of head or heel: Not therefore joins the Son  Manhood to Godhead, with more strength to foil  Thy enemy; nor so is overcome  Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise,  Disabled, not to give thee thy deaths wound:  Which he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,  Not by destroying Satan, but his works  In thee, and in thy seed: Nor can this be,  But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,  Obedience to the law of God, imposed  On penalty of death, and suffering death;  The penalty to thy transgression due,  And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:  So only can high Justice rest appaid.  The law of God exact he shall fulfil  Both by obedience and by love, though love  
Paradise Lost 
366 of 374 
Alone fulfil the law; thy punishment  He shall endure, by coming in the flesh  To a reproachful life, and cursed death;  Proclaiming life to all who shall believe  In his redemption; and that his obedience,  Imputed, becomes theirs by faith; his merits  To save them, not their own, though legal, works.  For this he shall live hated, be blasphemed,  Seised on by force, judged, and to death condemned  A shameful and accursed, nailed to the cross  By his own nation; slain for bringing life:  But to the cross he nails thy enemies,  The law that is against thee, and the sins  Of all mankind, with him there crucified,  Never to hurt them more who rightly trust  In this his satisfaction; so he dies,  But soon revives; Death over him no power  Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light  Return, the stars of morn shall see him rise  Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,  Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,  His death for Man, as many as offered life  Neglect not, and the benefit embrace  By faith not void of works: This God-like act  Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldest have died,  In sin for ever lost from life; this act  Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength,  Defeating Sin and Death, his two main arms;  And fix far deeper in his head their stings  
Paradise Lost 
367 of 374 
Than temporal death shall bruise the victors heel,  Or theirs whom he redeems; a death, like sleep,  A gentle wafting to immortal life.  Nor after resurrection shall he stay  Longer on earth, than certain times to appear  To his disciples, men who in his life  Still followed him; to them shall leave in charge  To teach all nations what of him they learned  And his salvation; them who shall believe  Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign  Of washing them from guilt of sin to life  Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,  For death, like that which the Redeemer died.  All nations they shall teach; for, from that day,  Not only to the sons of Abrahams loins  Salvation shall be preached, but to the sons  Of Abrahams faith wherever through the world;  So in his seed all nations shall be blest.  Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend  With victory, triumphing through the air  Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise  The Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains  Through all his realm, and there confounded leave;  Then enter into glory, and resume  His seat at Gods right hand, exalted high  Above all names in Heaven; and thence shall come,  When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,  With glory and power to judge both quick and dead;  To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward  
Paradise Lost 
368 of 374 
His faithful, and receive them into bliss,  Whether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth  Shall all be Paradise, far happier place  Than this of Eden, and far happier days.  So spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused,  As at the worlds great period; and our sire,  Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied.  O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!  That all this good of evil shall produce,  And evil turn to good; more wonderful  Than that which by creation first brought forth  Light out of darkness! Full of doubt I stand,  Whether I should repent me now of sin  By me done, and occasioned; or rejoice  Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring;  To God more glory, more good-will to Men  From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.  But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven  Must re-ascend, what will betide the few  His faithful, left among the unfaithful herd,  The enemies of truth? Who then shall guide  His people, who defend? Will they not deal  Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?  Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven  He to his own a Comforter will send,  The promise of the Father, who shall dwell  His Spirit within them; and the law of faith,  Working through love, upon their hearts shall write,  To guide them in all truth; and also arm  
Paradise Lost 
369 of 374 
With spiritual armour, able to resist  Satans assaults, and quench his fiery darts;  What man can do against them, not afraid,  Though to the death; against such cruelties  With inward consolations recompensed,  And oft supported so as shall amaze  Their proudest persecutors: For the Spirit,  Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends  To evangelize the nations, then on all  Baptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue  To speak all tongues, and do all miracles,  As did their Lord before them. Thus they win  Great numbers of each nation to receive  With joy the tidings brought from Heaven: At length  Their ministry performed, and race well run,  Their doctrine and their story written left,  They die; but in their room, as they forewarn,  Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves,  Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven  To their own vile advantages shall turn  Of lucre and ambition; and the truth  With superstitions and traditions taint,  Left only in those written records pure,  Though not but by the Spirit understood.  Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,  Places, and titles, and with these to join  Secular power; though feigning still to act  By spiritual, to themselves appropriating  The Spirit of God, promised alike and given  
Paradise Lost

To all believers; and, from that pretence,  Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force  On every conscience; laws which none shall find  Left them inrolled, or what the Spirit within  Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then  But force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind  His consort Liberty? what, but unbuild  His living temples, built by faith to stand,  Their own faith, not anothers? for, on earth,  Who against faith and conscience can be heard  Infallible? yet many will presume:  Whence heavy persecution shall arise  On all, who in the worship persevere  Of spirit and truth; the rest, far greater part,  Will deem in outward rites and specious forms  Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire  Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith  Rarely be found: So shall the world go on,  To good malignant, to bad men benign;  Under her own weight groaning; till the day  Appear of respiration to the just,  And vengeance to the wicked, at return  Of him so lately promised to thy aid,  The Womans Seed; obscurely then foretold,  Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord;  Last, in the clouds, from Heaven to be revealed  In glory of the Father, to dissolve  Satan with his perverted world; then raise  From the conflagrant mass, purged and refined,

New Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date,  Founded in righteousness, and peace, and love;  To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss.  He ended; and thus Adam last replied.  How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,  Measured this transient world, the race of time,  Till time stand fixed! Beyond is all abyss,  Eternity, whose end no eye can reach.  Greatly-instructed I shall hence depart;  Greatly in peace of thought; and have my fill  Of knowledge, what this vessel can contain;  Beyond which was my folly to aspire.  Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best,  And love with fear the only God; to walk  As in his presence; ever to observe  His providence; and on him sole depend,  Merciful over all his works, with good  Still overcoming evil, and by small  Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak  Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise  By simply meek: that suffering for truths sake  Is fortitude to highest victory,  And, to the faithful, death the gate of life;  Taught this by his example, whom I now  Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.  To whom thus also the Angel last replied.  This having learned, thou hast attained the sum  Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars  Thou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers,  
Paradise Lost 
372 of 374 
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,  Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea,  And all the riches of this world enjoyedst,  And all the rule, one empire; only add  Deeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith,  Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love,  By name to come called charity, the soul  Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth  To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess  A Paradise within thee, happier far.  Let us descend now therefore from this top  Of speculation; for the hour precise  Exacts our parting hence; and see!the guards,  By me encamped on yonder hill, expect  Their motion; at whose front a flaming sword,  In signal of remove, waves fiercely round:  We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;  Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed  Portending good, and all her spirits composed  To meek submission: thou, at season fit,  Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard;  Chiefly what may concern her faith to know,  The great deliverance by her seed to come  (For by the Womans seed) on all mankind:  That ye may live, which will be many days,  Both in one faith unanimous, though sad,  With cause, for evils past; yet much more cheered  With meditation on the happy end.  He ended, and they both descend the hill;

Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve  Lay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked;  And thus with words not sad she him received.  Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know;  For God is also in sleep; and dreams advise,  Which he hath sent propitious, some great good  Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress  Wearied I fell asleep: But now lead on;  In me is no delay; with thee to go,  Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,  Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me  Art all things under $Heaven, all places thou,  Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.  This further consolation yet secure  I carry hence; though all by me is lost,  Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed,  By me the Promised Seed shall all restore.  So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard  Well pleased, but answered not: For now, too nigh  The Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill  To their fixed station, all in bright array  The Cherubim descended; on the ground  Gliding meteorous, as evening-mist  Risen from a river oer the marish glides,  And gathers ground fast at the labourers heel  Homeward returning. High in front advanced,  The brandished sword of God before them blazed,  Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat,  And vapour as the Libyan air adust,

Began to parch that temperate clime; whereat  In either hand the hastening Angel caught  Our lingering parents, and to the eastern gate  Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast  To the subjected plain; then disappeared.  They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld  Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,  Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate  With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms:  Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon;  The world was all before them, where to choose  Their place of rest, and Providence their guide:  They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,  Through Eden took their solitary way.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page) We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2 million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text

INTRODUCTION
Perhaps the sentiments contained in the following pages, are not YET sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favour; a long habit of not thinking a thing WRONG, gives it a superficial appearance of being RIGHT, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of custom.  But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than reason. As a long and violent abuse of power, is generally the Means of calling the right of it in question (and in Matters too which might never have been thought of, had not the Sufferers been aggravated into the inquiry) and as the King of England hath undertaken in his OWN RIGHT, to support the Parliament in what he calls THEIRS, and as the good people of this country are grievously oppressed by the combination, they have an undoubted privilege to inquire into the pretensions of both, and equally to reject the usurpation of either. In the following sheets, the author hath studiously avoided every thing which is personal among ourselves.  Compliments as well as censure to individuals make no part thereof.  The wise, and the worthy, need not the triumph of a pamphlet; and those whose sentiments are injudicious, or unfriendly, will cease of themselves unless too much pains are bestowed upon their conversion.
The cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind. Many circumstances hath, and will arise, which are not local, but universal, and through which the principles of all Lovers of Mankind are affected, and in the Event of which, their Affections are interested. The laying a Country desolate with Fire and Sword, declaring War against the natural rights of all Mankind, and extirpating the Defenders thereof from the Face of the Earth, is the Concern of every Man to whom Nature hath given the Power of feeling; of which Class, regardless of Party Censure, is the AUTHOR. P.S.  The Publication of this new Edition hath been delayed, with a View of taking notice (had it been necessary) of any Attempt to refute the Doctrine of Independance: As no Answer hath yet appeared, it is now presumed that none will, the Time needful for getting such a Performance ready for the Public being considerably past. Who the Author of this Production is, is wholly unnecessary to the Public, as the Object for Attention is the DOCTRINE ITSELF, not the MAN.  Yet it may not be unnecessary to say, That he is unconnected with any Party, and under no sort of Influence public or private, but the influence of reason and principle. Philadelphia, February 14, 1776
OF THE ORIGIN AND DESIGN OF GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL. WITH CONCISE REMARKS ON THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION
Some writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave little or no distinction between them; whereas they are not only different, but have different origins. Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness; the former promotes our POSITIVELY by uniting our affections, the latter NEGATIVELY by restraining our vices.  The one encourages intercourse, the other creates distinctions. The first a patron, the last a punisher. Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries BY A GOVERNMENT, which we might expect in a country WITHOUT GOVERNMENT, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise.  For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least.  WHEREFORE, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows, that whatever FORM thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others. In order to gain a clear and just idea of the design and end of
government, let us suppose a small number of persons settled in some sequestered part of the earth, unconnected with the rest, they will then represent the first peopling of any country, or of the world. In this state of natural liberty, society will be their first thought. A thousand motives will excite them thereto, the strength of one man is so unequal to his wants, and his mind so unfitted for perpetual solitude, that he is soon obliged to seek assistance and relief of another, who in his turn requires the same.  Four or five united would be able to raise a tolerable dwelling in the midst of a wilderness, but one man might labour out of the common period of life without accomplishing any thing; when he had felled his timber he could not remove it, nor erect it after it was removed; hunger in the mean time would urge him from his work, and every different want call him a different way.  Disease, nay even misfortune would be death, for though neither might be mortal, yet either would disable him from living, and reduce him to a state in which he might rather be said to perish than to die. Thus necessity, like a gravitating power, would soon form our newly arrived emigrants into society, the reciprocal blessings of which, would supersede, and render the obligations of law and government unnecessary while they remained perfectly just to each other; but as nothing but heaven is impregnable to vice, it will unavoidably happen, that in proportion as they surmount the first difficulties of emigration, which bound them together in a common cause, they will begin to relax in their duty and attachment to each other; and this remissness will point out the necessity of establishing some form of government to supply the defect of moral virtue. Some convenient tree will afford them a State-House, under the branches of which, the whole colony may assemble to deliberate on public matters. It is more than probable that their first laws will have the title only of REGULATIONS, and be enforced by no other penalty than public disesteem. In this first parliament every man, by natural right, will have a seat. But as the colony increases, the public concerns will increase likewise, and the distance at which the members may be separated, will render it too inconvenient for all of them to meet on every occasion as at first, when their number was small, their habitations near, and the public concerns few and trifling. This will point out the convenience of their consenting to leave the legislative part to be managed by a select number chosen from the whole body, who are supposed to have the same concerns at stake which those who appointed them, and who will act in the same manner as the whole body would act, were they present. If the colony continues increasing, it will become necessary to augment the number of the representatives, and that the interest of every part of the colony may be attended to, it will be found best to divide the whole into convenient parts, each part sending its proper number; and that the ELECTED might never form to themselves an interest separate from the ELECTORS, prudence will point out the propriety of having elections often; because as the ELECTED might by that means return and mix again with the general body of the ELECTORS in a few months, their fidelity to the public will be secured by the prudent reflection of not making a rod for themselves.  And as this frequent interchange will establish a common interest with every part of the community, they will mutually and naturally support each other, and on this (not on the unmeaning name of king) depends the STRENGTH OF GOVERNMENT,
AND THE HAPPINESS OF THE GOVERNED. Here then is the origin and rise of government; namely, a mode rendered necessary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the world; here too is the design and end of government, viz. freedom and security. And however our eyes may be dazzled with show, or our ears deceived by sound; however prejudice may warp our wills, or interest darken our understanding, the simple voice of nature and of reason will say, it is right. I draw my idea of the form of government from a principle in nature, which no art can overturn, viz. that the more simple any thing is, the less liable it is to be disordered; and the easier repaired when disordered; and with this maxim in view, I offer a few remarks on the so much boasted constitution of England.  That it was noble for the dark and slavish times in which it was erected, is granted. When the world was overrun with tyranny the least remove therefrom was a glorious rescue.  But that it is imperfect, subject to convulsions, and incapable of producing what it seems to promise, is easily demonstrated. Absolute governments (tho' the disgrace of human nature) have this advantage with them, that they are simple; if the people suffer, they know the head from which their suffering springs, know likewise the remedy, and are not bewildered by a variety of causes and cures. But the constitution of England is so exceedingly complex, that the nation may suffer for years together without being able to discover in which part the fault lies; some will say in one and some in another, and every political physician will advise a different medicine. I know it is difficult to get over local or long standing prejudices, yet if we will suffer ourselves to examine the component parts of the English constitution, we shall find them to be the base remains of two ancient tyrannies, compounded with some new republican materials.
FIRST - The remains of monarchial tyranny in the person of the king. SECONDLY - The remains of aristocratical tyranny in the persons of the peers. THIRDLY - The new republican materials in the persons of the commons,          on whose virtue depends the freedom of England.
The two first, by being hereditary, are independent of the people; wherefore in a CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE they contribute nothing towards the freedom of the state. To say that the constitution of England is a UNION of three powers reciprocally CHECKING each other, is farcical, either the words have no meaning, or they are flat contradictions. To say that the commons is a check upon the king, presupposes two things: FIRST - That the king is not to be trusted without being looked after, or in other words, that a thirst for absolute power is the natural disease of monarchy. SECONDLY - That the commons, by being appointed for that purpose, are either wiser or more worthy of confidence than the crown. But as the same constitution which gives the commons a power to check the king by withholding the supplies, gives afterwards the king a power
to check the commons, by empowering him to reject their other bills; it again supposes that the king is wiser than those whom it has already supposed to be wiser than him.  A mere absurdity! There is something exceedingly ridiculous in the composition of monarchy; it first excludes a man from the means of information, yet empowers him to act in cases where the highest judgment is required.  The state of a king shuts him from the world, yet the business of a king requires him to know it thoroughly; wherefore the different parts, by unnaturally opposing and destroying each other, prove the whole character to be absurd and useless. Some writers have explained the English constitution thus: The king, say they, is one, the people another; the peers are a house in behalf of the king, the commons in behalf of the people; but this hath all the distinctions of a house divided against itself; and though the expressions be pleasantly arranged, yet when examined, they appear idle and ambiguous; and it will always happen, that the nicest construction that words are capable of, when applied to the description of some thing which either cannot exist, or is too incomprehensible to be within the compass of description, will be words of sound only, and though they may amuse the ear, they cannot inform the mind, for this explanation includes a previous question, viz. HOW CAME THE KING BY A POWER WHICH THE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO TRUST, AND ALWAYS OBLIGED TO CHECK?  Such a power could not be the gift of a wise people, neither can any power, WHICH NEEDS CHECKING, be from God; yet the provision, which the constitution makes, supposes such a power to exist. But the provision is unequal to the task; the means either cannot or will not accomplish the end, and the whole affair is a felo de se; for as the greater weight will always carry up the less, and as all the wheels of a machine are put in motion by one, it only remains to know which power in the constitution has the most weight, for that will govern; and though the others, or a part of them, may clog, or, as the phrase is, check the rapidity of its motion, yet so long as they cannot stop it, their endeavours will be ineffectual; the first moving power will at last have its way, and what it wants in speed, is supplied by time. That the crown is this overbearing part in the English constitution, needs not be mentioned, and that it derives its whole consequence merely from being the giver of places and pensions, is self-evident, wherefore, though we have been wise enough to shut and lock a door against absolute monarchy, we at the same time have been foolish enough to put the crown in possession of the key. The prejudice of Englishmen in favour of their own government by king, lords, and commons, arises as much or more from national pride than reason. Individuals are undoubtedly safer in England than in some other countries, but the WILL of the king is as much the LAW of the land in Britain as in France, with this difference, that instead of proceeding directly from his mouth, it is handed to the people under the more formidable shape of an act of parliament.  For the fate of Charles the First hath only made kings more subtle--not more just. Wherefore, laying aside all national pride and prejudice in favour of modes and forms, the plain truth is, that IT IS WHOLLY OWING TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PEOPLE, AND NOT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT,
that the crown is not as oppressive in England as in Turkey. An inquiry into the CONSTITUTIONAL ERRORS in the English form of government is at this time highly necessary; for as we are never in a proper condition of doing justice to others, while we continue under the influence of some leading partiality, so neither are we capable of doing it to ourselves while we remain fettered by any obstinate prejudice. And as a man, who is attached to a prostitute, is unfitted to choose or judge a wife, so any prepossession in favour of a rotten constitution of government will disable us from discerning a good one.
OF MONARCHY AND HEREDITARY SUCCESSION
Mankind being originally equals in the order of creation, the equality could only be destroyed by some subsequent circumstance; the distinctions of rich, and poor, may in a great measure be accounted for, and that without having recourse to the harsh, ill-sounding names of oppression and avarice. Oppression is often the CONSEQUENCE, but seldom or never the MEANS of riches; and though avarice will preserve a man from being necessitously poor, it generally makes him too timorous to be wealthy. But there is another and greater distinction, for which no truly natural or religious reason can be assigned, and that is, the distinction of men into KINGS and SUBJECTS.  Male and female are the distinctions of nature, good and bad the distinctions of heaven; but how a race of men came into the world so exalted above the rest, and distinguished like some new species, is worth inquiring into, and whether they are the means of happiness or of misery to mankind. In the early ages of the world, according to the scripture chronology, there were no kings; the consequence of which was, there were no wars; it is the pride of kings which throw mankind into confusion.  Holland without a king hath enjoyed more peace for this last century than any of the  monarchial governments in Europe.  Antiquity favours the same remark; for the quiet and rural lives of the first patriarchs hath a happy something in them, which vanishes away when we come to the history of Jewish royalty. Government by kings was first introduced into the world by the Heathens, from whom the children of Israel copied the custom. It was the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.  The Heathens paid divine honours to their deceased kings, and the Christian world hath improved on the plan, by doing the same to their living ones.  How impious is the title of sacred majesty applied to a worm, who in the midst of his splendor is crumbling into dust! As the exalting one man so greatly above the rest cannot be justified on the equal rights of nature, so neither can it be defended on the authority of scripture; for the will of the Almighty, as declared by Gideon and the prophet Samuel, expressly disapproves of government by kings.  All anti-monarchical parts of scripture have been very smoothly glossed over in monarchical governments, but they undoubtedly merit the attention of countries which have their governments yet to form.
RENDER UNTO CAESAR THE THINGS WHICH ARE CAESAR'S is the scripture doctrine of courts, yet it is no support of monarchical government, for the Jews at that time were without a king, and in a state of vassalage to the Romans. Now three thousand years passed away from the Mosaic account of the creation, till the Jews under a national delusion requested a king. Till then their form of government (except in extraordinary cases, where the Almighty interposed) was a kind of republic administered by a judge and the elders of the tribes.  Kings they had none, and it was held sinful to acknowledge any being under that title but the Lord of Hosts.  And when a man seriously reflects on the idolatrous homage which is paid to the persons of kings, he need not wonder that the Almighty, ever jealous of his honour, should disapprove of a form of government which so impiously invades the prerogative of heaven. Monarchy is ranked in scripture as one of the sins of the Jews, for which a curse in reserve is denounced against them. The history of that transaction is worth attending to. The children of Israel being oppressed by the Midianites, Gideon marched against them with a small army, and victory, through the divine interposition, decided in his favour.  The Jews, elate with success, and attributing it to the generalship of Gideon, proposed making him a king, saying, RULE THOU OVER US, THOU AND THY SON AND THY SON'S SON.  Here was temptation in its fullest extent; not a kingdom only, but an hereditary one, but Gideon in the piety of his soul replied, I WILL NOT RULE OVER YOU, NEITHER SHALL MY SON RULE OVER YOU _THE LORD SHALL RULE OVER YOU._ Words need not be more explicit; Gideon doth not decline the honour, but denieth their right to give it; neither doth he compliment them with invented declarations of his thanks, but in the positive style of a prophet charges them with disaffection to their proper Sovereign, the King of heaven. About one hundred and thirty years after this, they fell again into the same error.  The hankering which the Jews had for the idolatrous customs of the Heathens, is something exceedingly unaccountable; but so it was, that laying hold of the misconduct of Samuel's two sons, who were entrusted with some secular concerns, they came in an abrupt and clamorous manner to Samuel, saying, BEHOLD THOU ART OLD, AND THY SONS WALK NOT IN THY WAYS, NOW MAKE US A KING TO JUDGE US, LIKE ALL OTHER NATIONS.  And here we cannot but observe that their motives were bad, viz. that they might be LIKE unto other nations, i.e.  the Heathens, whereas their true glory laid in being as much UNLIKE them as possible.  BUT THE THING DISPLEASED SAMUEL WHEN THEY SAID, GIVE US A KING TO JUDGE US; AND SAMUEL PRAYED UNTO THE LORD, AND THE LORD SAID UNTO SAMUEL, HEARKEN UNTO THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE IN ALL THAT THEY SAY UNTO THEE, FOR THEY HAVE NOT REJECTED THEE, BUT THEY HAVE REJECTED ME, _THAT I SHOULD NOT REIGN OVER THEM._  ACCORDING TO ALL THE WORKS WHICH THEY HAVE SINCE THE DAY THAT I BROUGHT THEM UP OUT OF EGYPT, EVEN UNTO THIS DAY; WHEREWITH THEY HAVE FORSAKEN ME AND SERVED OTHER GODS; SO DO THEY ALSO UNTO THEE.  NOW THEREFORE HEARKEN UNTO THEIR VOICE, HOWBEIT, PROTEST SOLEMNLY UNTO THEM AND SHEW THEM THE MANNER OF THE KING THAT SHALL REIGN OVER THEM, I.E.  not of any particular king, but the general manner of the kings of the earth, whom Israel was so eagerly copying after.  And notwithstanding the great distance of time and difference of manners, the character is
still in fashion.  AND SAMUEL TOLD ALL THE WORDS OF THE LORD UNTO THE PEOPLE, THAT ASKED OF HIM A KING.  AND HE SAID, THIS SHALL BE THE MANNER OF THE KING THAT SHALL REIGN OVER YOU; HE WILL TAKE YOUR SONS AND APPOINT THEM FOR HIMSELF, FOR HIS CHARIOTS, AND TO BE HIS HORSEMAN, AND SOME SHALL RUN BEFORE HIS CHARIOTS (this description agrees with the present mode of impressing men) AND HE WILL APPOINT HIM CAPTAINS OVER THOUSANDS AND CAPTAINS OVER FIFTIES, AND WILL SET THEM TO EAR HIS GROUND AND REAP HIS HARVEST, AND TO MAKE HIS INSTRUMENTS OF WAR, AND INSTRUMENTS OF HIS CHARIOTS; AND HE WILL TAKE YOUR DAUGHTERS TO BE CONFECTIONARIES, AND TO BE COOKS AND TO BE BAKERS (this describes the expense and luxury as well as the oppression of kings) AND HE WILL TAKE YOUR FIELDS AND YOUR OLIVE YARDS, EVEN THE BEST OF THEM, AND GIVE THEM TO HIS SERVANTS; AND HE WILL TAKE THE TENTH OF YOUR SEED, AND OF YOUR VINEYARDS, AND GIVE THEM TO HIS OFFICERS AND TO HIS SERVANTS (by which we see that bribery, corruption, and favouritism are the standing vices of kings) AND HE WILL TAKE THE TENTH OF YOUR MEN SERVANTS, AND YOUR MAID SERVANTS, AND YOUR GOODLIEST YOUNG MEN AND YOUR ASSES, AND PUT THEM TO HIS WORK; AND HE WILL TAKE THE TENTH OF YOUR SHEEP, AND YE SHALL BE HIS SERVANTS, AND YE SHALL CRY OUT IN THAT DAY BECAUSE OF YOUR KING WHICH YE SHALL HAVE CHOSEN, _AND THE LORD WILL NOT HEAR YOU IN THAT DAY._ This accounts for the continuation of monarchy; neither do the characters of the few good kings which have lived since, either sanctify the title, or blot out the sinfulness of the origin; the high encomium given of David takes no notice of him OFFICIALLY AS A KING, but only as a MAN after God's own heart. NEVERTHELESS THE PEOPLE REFUSED TO OBEY THE VOICE OF SAMUEL, AND THEY SAID, NAY, BUT WE WILL HAVE A KING OVER US, THAT WE MAY BE LIKE ALL THE NATIONS, AND THAT OUR KING MAY JUDGE US, AND GO OUT BEFORE US, AND FIGHT OUR BATTLES. Samuel continued to reason with them, but to no purpose; he set before them their ingratitude, but all would not avail; and seeing them fully bent on their folly, he cried out, I WILL CALL UNTO THE LORD, AND HE SHALL SEND THUNDER AND RAIN (which then was a punishment, being in the time of wheat harvest) THAT YE MAY PERCEIVE AND SEE THAT YOUR WICKEDNESS IS GREAT WHICH YE HAVE DONE IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD, AND THE LORD SENT THUNDER AND RAIN THAT DAY, AND ALL THE PEOPLE GREATLY FEARED THE LORD AND SAMUEL.  AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAID UNTO SAMUEL, PRAY FOR THY SERVANTS UNTO THE LORD THY GOD THAT WE DIE NOT, FOR _WE HAVE ADDED UNTO OUR SINS THIS EVIL, TO ASK A KING._ These portions of scripture are direct and positive. They admit of no equivocal construction.  That the Almighty hath here entered his protest against monarchical government, is true, or the scripture is false.  And a man hath good reason to believe that there is as much of kingcraft, as priestcraft, in withholding the scripture from the public in Popish countries. For monarchy in every instance is the Popery of government. To the evil of monarchy we have added that of hereditary succession; and as the first is a degradation and lessening of ourselves, so the second, claimed as a matter of right, is an insult and an imposition on posterity.  For all men being originally equals, no ONE by BIRTH could have a right to set up his own family in perpetual preference to all others for ever, and though himself might deserve SOME decent degree of honours of his contemporaries, yet his descendants might
be far too unworthy to inherit them.  One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION. Secondly, as no man at first could possess any other public honours than were bestowed upon him, so the givers of those honours could have no power to give away the right of posterity.  And though they might say, "We choose you for OUR head," they could not, without manifest injustice to their children, say, "that your children and your children's children shall reign over OURS for ever."  Because such an unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool. Most wise men, in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest. This is supposing the present race of kings in the world to have had an honourable origin; whereas it is more than probable, that could we take off the dark covering of antiquities, and trace them to their first rise, that we should find the first of them nothing better than the principal ruffian of some restless gang, whose savage manners or preeminence in subtlety obtained the title of chief among plunderers; and who by increasing in power, and extending his depredations, overawed the quiet and defenseless to purchase their safety by frequent contributions.  Yet his electors could have no idea of giving hereditary right to his descendants, because such a perpetual exclusion of themselves was incompatible with the free and unrestrained principles they professed to live by.  Wherefore, hereditary succession in the early ages of monarchy could not take place as a matter of claim, but as something casual or complemental; but as few or no records were extant in those days,  and traditional history stuffed with fables, it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed, Mahomet like, to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.  Perhaps the disorders which threatened, or seemed to threaten, on the decease of a leader and the choice of a new one (for elections among ruffians could not be very orderly) induced many at first to favour hereditary pretensions; by which means it happened, as it hath happened since, that what at first was submitted to as a convenience, was afterwards claimed as a right. England, since the conquest, hath known some few good monarchs, but groaned beneath a much larger number of bad ones; yet no man in his senses can say that their claim under William the Conqueror is a very honourable one.  A French bastard landing with an armed banditti, and establishing himself king of England against the consent of the natives, is in plain terms a very paltry rascally original.  It certainly hath no divinity in it.  However, it is needless to spend much time in exposing the folly of hereditary right; if there are any so weak as to believe it, let them promiscuously worship the ass and lion, and welcome. I shall neither copy their humility, nor disturb their devotion. Yet I should be glad to ask how they suppose kings came at first?  The question admits but of three answers, viz. either by lot, by election, or by usurpation.  If the first king was taken by lot, it establishes a precedent for the next, which excludes hereditary succession.  Saul was by lot, yet the succession was not hereditary, neither does it appear
from that transaction there was any intention it ever should be.  If the first king of any country was by election, that likewise establishes a precedent for the next; for to say, that the RIGHT of all future generations is taken away, by the act of the first electors, in their choice not only of a king, but of a family of kings for ever, hath no parallel in or out of scripture but the doctrine of original sin, which supposes the free will of all men lost in Adam; and from such comparison, and it will admit of no other, hereditary succession can derive no glory.  For as in Adam all sinned, and as in the first electors all men obeyed; as in the one all mankind were subjected to Satan, and in the other to Sovereignty; as our innocence was lost in the first, and our authority in the last; and as both disable us from reassuming some former state and privilege, it unanswerably follows that original sin and hereditary succession are parallels. Dishonourable rank! Inglorious connection!  Yet the most subtle sophist cannot produce a juster simile. As to usurpation, no man will be so hardy as to defend it; and that William the Conqueror was an usurper is a fact not to be contradicted. The plain truth is, that the antiquity of English monarchy will not bear looking into. But it is not so much the absurdity as the evil of hereditary succession which concerns mankind.  Did it ensure a race of good and wise men it would have the seal of divine authority, but as it opens a door to the FOOLISH, the WICKED, and the IMPROPER, it hath in it the nature of oppression.  Men who look upon themselves born to reign, and others to obey, soon grow insolent; selected from the rest of mankind their minds are early poisoned by importance; and the world they act in differs so materially from the world at large, that they have but little opportunity of knowing its true interests, and when they succeed to the government are frequently the most ignorant and unfit of any throughout the dominions. Another evil which attends hereditary succession is, that the throne is subject to be possessed by a minor at any age; all which time the regency, acting under the cover of a king, have every opportunity and inducement to betray their trust.  The same national misfortune happens, when a king, worn out with age and infirmity, enters the last stage of human weakness.  In both these cases the public becomes a prey to every miscreant, who can tamper successfully with the follies either of age or infancy. The most plausible plea, which hath ever been offered in favour of hereditary succession, is, that it preserves a nation from civil wars; and were this true, it would be weighty; whereas, it is the most barefaced falsity ever imposed upon mankind.  The whole history of England disowns the fact.  Thirty kings and two minors have reigned in that distracted kingdom since the conquest, in which time there have been (including the Revolution) no less than eight civil wars and nineteen rebellions.  Wherefore instead of making for peace, it makes against it, and destroys the very foundation it seems to stand on. The contest for monarchy and succession, between the houses of York and Lancaster, laid England in a scene of blood for many years. Twelve pitched battles, besides skirmishes and sieges, were fought between Henry and Edward.  Twice was Henry prisoner to Edward, who in his turn was prisoner to Henry.  And so uncertain is the fate of war and the temper of a nation, when nothing but personal matters are the ground
of a quarrel, that Henry was taken in triumph from a prison to a palace, and Edward obliged to fly from a palace to a foreign land; yet, as sudden transitions of temper are seldom lasting, Henry in his turn was driven from the throne, and Edward recalled to succeed him. The parliament always following the strongest side. This contest began in the reign of Henry the Sixth, and was not entirely extinguished till Henry the Seventh, in whom the families were united. Including a period of 67 years, viz. from 1422 to 1489. In short, monarchy and succession have laid (not this or that kingdom only) but the world in blood and ashes.  'Tis a form of government which the word of God bears testimony against, and blood will attend it. If we inquire into the business of a king, we shall find that in some countries they have none; and after sauntering away their lives without pleasure to themselves or advantage to the nation, withdraw from the scene, and leave their successors to tread the same idle ground.  In absolute monarchies the whole weight of business, civil and military, lies on the king; the children of Israel in their request for a king, urged this plea "that he may judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles."  But in countries where he is neither a judge nor a general, as in England, a man would be puzzled to know what IS his business. The nearer any government approaches to a republic the less business there is for a king.  It is somewhat difficult to find a proper name for the government of England.  Sir William Meredith calls it a republic; but in its present state it is unworthy of the name, because the corrupt influence of the crown, by having all the places in its disposal, hath so effectually swallowed up the power, and eaten out the virtue of the house of commons (the republican part in the constitution) that the government of England is nearly as monarchical as that of France or Spain.  Men fall out with names without understanding them. For it is the republican and not the monarchical part of the constitution of England which Englishmen glory in, viz. the liberty of choosing an house of commons from out of their own body--and it is easy to see that when republican virtue fails, slavery ensues.  Why is the constitution of England sickly, but because monarchy hath poisoned the republic, the crown hath engrossed the commons? In England a king hath little more to do than to make war and give away places; which in plain terms, is to impoverish the nation and set it together by the ears.  A pretty business indeed for a man to be allowed eight hundred thousand sterling a year for, and worshipped into the bargain!  Of more worth is one honest man to society and in the sight of God, than all the crowned ruffians that ever lived.
THOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT STATE OF AMERICAN AFFAIRS
In the following pages I offer nothing more than simple facts, plain arguments, and common sense; and have no other Preliminaries to settle with the reader, than that he will divest himself of prejudice
and prepossession, and suffer his reason and his feelings to determine for themselves; that he will put ON, or rather that he will not put OFF the true character of a man, and generously enlarge his views beyond the present day. Volumes have been written on the subject of the struggle between England and America.  Men of all ranks have embarked in the controversy, from different motives, and with various designs; but all have been ineffectual, and the period of debate is closed.  Arms, as the last resource, decide this contest; the appeal was the choice of the king, and the continent hath accepted the challenge. It hath been reported of the late Mr. Pelham (who tho' an able minister was not without his faults) that on his being attacked in the house of commons, on the score, that his measures were only of a temporary kind, replied "THEY WILL LAST MY TIME." Should a thought so fatal and unmanly possess the colonies in the present contest, the name of ancestors will be remembered by future generations with detestation. The sun never shined on a cause of greater worth.  'Tis not the affair of a city, a county, a province, or a kingdom, but of a continent--of at least one eighth part of the habitable globe. 'Tis not the concern of a day, a year, or an age; posterity are virtually involved in the contest, and will be more or less affected, even to the end of time, by the proceedings now. Now is the seed-time of continental union, faith and honour. The least fracture now will be like a name engraved with the point of a pin on the tender rind of a young oak; the wound will enlarge with the tree, and posterity read it in full grown characters. By referring the matter from argument to arms, a new aera for politics is struck; a new method of thinking hath arisen. All plans, proposals, &c.  prior to the nineteenth of April, i.  e.  to the commencement of hostilities, are like the almanacs of the last year; which, though proper then are superseded and useless now.  Whatever was advanced by the advocates on either side of the question then, terminated in one and the same point.  viz. a union with Great-Britain: the only difference between the parties was the method of effecting it; the one proposing force, the other friendship; but it hath so far happened that the first hath failed, and the second hath withdrawn her influence. As much hath been said of the advantages of reconciliation which, like an agreeable dream, hath passed away and left us as we were, it is but right, that we should examine the contrary side of the argument, and inquire into some of the many material injuries which these colonies sustain, and always will sustain, by being connected with, and dependent on Great Britain: To examine that connection and dependence, on the principles of nature and common sense, to see what we have to trust to, if separated, and what we are to expect, if dependant. I have heard it asserted by some, that as America hath flourished under her former connection with Great Britain that the same connection is necessary towards her future happiness, and will always have the same effect. Nothing can be more fallacious than this kind of argument.
We may as well assert that because a child has thrived upon milk that it is never to have meat, or that the first twenty years of our lives is to become a precedent for the next twenty. But even this is admitting more than is true, for I answer roundly, that America would have flourished as much, and probably much more, had no European power had any thing to do with her.  The commerce, by which she hath enriched herself, are the necessaries of life, and will always have a market while eating is the custom of Europe. But she has protected us, say some.  That she has engrossed us is true, and defended the continent at our expense as well as her own is admitted, and she would have defended Turkey from the same motive, viz. the sake of trade and dominion. Alas, we have been long led away by ancient prejudices, and made large sacrifices to superstition.  We have boasted the protection of Great Britain, without considering, that her motive was INTEREST not ATTACHMENT; that she did not protect us from OUR ENEMIES on OUR ACCOUNT, but from HER ENEMIES on HER OWN ACCOUNT, from those who had no quarrel with us on any OTHER ACCOUNT, and who will always be our enemies on the SAME ACCOUNT. Let Britain wave her pretensions to the continent, or the continent throw off the dependence, and we should be at peace with France and Spain were they at war with Britain. The miseries of Hanover last war ought to warn us against connections. It has lately been asserted in parliament, that the colonies have no relation to each other but through the parent country, i. e. that Pennsylvania and the Jerseys, and so on for the rest, are sister colonies by the way of England; this is certainly a very round-about way of proving relationship, but it is the nearest and only true way of proving enemyship, if I may so call it. France and Spain never were, nor perhaps ever will be our enemies as AMERICANS, but as our being the subjects of GREAT BRITAIN. But Britain is the parent country, say some.  Then the more shame upon her conduct.  Even brutes do not devour their young, nor savages make war upon their families; wherefore the assertion, if true, turns to her reproach; but it happens not to be true, or only partly so and the phrase PARENT or MOTHER COUNTRY hath been jesuitically adopted by the king and his parasites, with a low papistical design of gaining an unfair bias on the credulous weakness of our minds.  Europe, and not England, is the parent country of America.  This new world hath been the asylum for the persecuted lovers of civil and religious liberty from EVERY PART of Europe.  Hither have they fled, not from the tender embraces of the mother, but from the cruelty of the monster; and it is so far true of England, that the same tyranny which drove the first emigrants from home, pursues their descendants still. In this extensive quarter of the globe, we forget the narrow limits of three hundred and sixty miles (the extent of England) and carry our friendship on a larger scale; we claim brotherhood with every European Christian, and triumph in the generosity of the sentiment. It is pleasant to observe by what regular gradations we surmount the force of local prejudice, as we enlarge our acquaintance with the world.  A man born in any town
in England divided into parishes, will naturally associate most with his fellow-parishioners (because their interests in many cases will be common) and distinguish him by the name of NEIGHBOUR; if he meet him but a few miles from home, he drops the narrow idea of a street, and salutes him by the name of TOWNSMAN; if he travel out of the county, and meet him in any other, he forgets the minor divisions of street and town, and calls him COUNTRYMAN, i.  e.  COUNTRYMAN; but if in their foreign excursions they should associate in France or any other part of EUROPE, their local remembrance would be enlarged into that of ENGLISHMEN.  And by a just parity of reasoning, all Europeans meeting in America, or any other quarter of the globe, are COUNTRYMEN; for England, Holland, Germany, or Sweden, when compared with the whole, stand in the same places on the larger scale, which the divisions of street, town, and county do on the smaller ones; distinctions too limited for continental minds.  Not one third of the inhabitants, even of this province, are of English descent. Wherefore I reprobate the phrase of parent or mother country applied to England only, as being false, selfish, narrow and ungenerous. But admitting, that we were all of English descent, what does it amount to?  Nothing.  Britain, being now an open enemy, extinguishes every other name and title:  And to say that reconciliation is our duty, is truly farcical.  The first king of England, of the present line (William the Conqueror) was a Frenchman, and half the Peers of England are descendants from the same country; therefore, by the same method of reasoning, England ought to be governed by France. Much hath been said of the united strength of Britain and the colonies, that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world.  But this is mere presumption; the fate of war is uncertain, neither do the expressions mean any thing; for this continent would never suffer itself to be drained of inhabitants, to support the British arms in either Asia, Africa, or Europe. Besides what have we to do with setting the world at defiance? Our plan is commerce, and that, well attended to, will secure us the peace and friendship of all Europe; because, it is the interest of all Europe to have America a FREE PORT.  Her trade will always be a protection, and her barrenness of gold and silver secure her from invaders. I challenge the warmest advocate for reconciliation, to shew, a single advantage that this continent can reap, by being connected with Great Britain.  I repeat the challenge, not a single advantage is derived.  Our corn will fetch its price in any market in Europe, and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them where we will. But the injuries and disadvantages we sustain by that connection, are without number; and our duty to mankind at large, as well as to ourselves, instruct us to renounce the alliance: Because, any submission to, or dependence on Great Britain, tends directly to involve this continent in European wars and quarrels; and sets us at variance with nations, who would otherwise seek our friendship, and against whom, we have neither anger nor complaint.  As Europe is our market for trade, we ought to form no partial connection with any part of it. It is the true interest of America to steer clear of European contentions, which she never can do, while by her dependence on Britain, she is made the make-weight in the scale of British politics.
Europe is too thickly planted with kingdoms to be long at peace, and whenever a war breaks out between England and any foreign power, the trade of America goes to ruin, BECAUSE OF HER CONNECTION WITH ENGLAND. The next war may not turn out like the last, and should it not, the advocates for reconciliation now, will be wishing for separation then, because, neutrality in that case, would be a safer convoy than a man of war. Every thing that is right or natural pleads for separation.  The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries, 'TIS TIME TO PART. Even the distance at which the Almighty hath placed England and America, is a strong and natural proof, that the authority of the one, over the other, was never the design of Heaven.  The time likewise at which the continent was discovered, adds weight to the argument, and the manner in which it was peopled increases the force of it.  The reformation was preceded by the discovery of America, as if the Almighty graciously meant to open a sanctuary to the Persecuted in future years, when home should afford neither friendship nor safety. The authority of Great Britain over this continent, is a form of government, which sooner or later must have an end: And a serious mind can draw no true pleasure by looking forward under the painful and positive conviction, that what he calls "the present constitution" is merely temporary.  As parents, we can have no joy, knowing that THIS GOVERNMENT is not sufficiently lasting to ensure any thing which we may bequeath to posterity: And by a plain method of argument, as we are running the next generation into debt, we ought to do the work of it, otherwise we use them meanly and pitifully.  In order to discover the line of our duty rightly, we should take our children in our hand, and fix our station a few years farther into life; that eminence will present a prospect, which a few present fears and prejudices conceal from our sight. Though I would carefully avoid giving unnecessary offense, yet I am inclined to believe, that all those who espouse the doctrine of reconciliation, may be included within the following descriptions. Interested men, who are not to be trusted; weak men, who CANNOT see; prejudiced men, who WILL NOT see; and a certain set of moderate men, who think better of the European world than it deserves; and this last class, by an ill-judged deliberation, will be the cause of more calamities to this continent, than all the other three. It is the good fortune of many to live distant from the scene of sorrow; the evil is not sufficient brought to their doors to make THEM feel the precariousness with which all American property is possessed. But let our imaginations transport us for a few moments to Boston, that seat of wretchedness will teach us wisdom, and instruct us for ever to renounce a power in whom we can have no trust. The inhabitants of that unfortunate city, who but a few months ago were in ease and affluence, have now, no other alternative than to stay and starve, or turn and beg.  Endangered by the fire of their friends if they continue within the city, and plundered by the soldiery if they leave it.  In their present condition they are prisoners without the hope of redemption, and in a general attack for their relief, they would be exposed to the fury of both armies. Men of passive tempers look somewhat lightly over the offenses of Britain, and, still hoping for the best, are apt to call out, "COME, COME, WE SHALL BE FRIENDS AGAIN, FOR ALL THIS."
But examine the passions and feelings of mankind, Bring the doctrine of reconciliation to the touchstone of nature, and then tell me, whether you can hereafter love, honor, and faithfully serve the power that hath carried fire and sword into your land?  If you cannot do all these, then are you only deceiving yourselves, and by your delay bringing ruin upon posterity.  Your future connection with Britain, whom you can neither love nor honor will be forced and unnatural, and being formed only on the plan of present convenience, will in a little time fall into a relapse more wretched than the first. But if you say, you can still pass the violations over, then I ask, Hath your house been burnt? Hath your property been destroyed before your face! Are your wife and children destitute of a bed to lie on, or bread to live on? Have you lost a parent or a child by their hands, and yourself the ruined and wretched survivor!  If you have not, then are you not a judge of those who have.  But if you have, and still can shake hands with the murderers, then are you unworthy of the name of husband, father, friend, or lover, and whatever may be your rank or title in life, you have the heart of a coward, and the spirit of a sycophant. This is not inflaming or exaggerating matters, but trying them by those feelings and affections which nature justifies, and without which, we should be incapable of discharging the social duties of life, or enjoying the felicities of it. I mean not to exhibit horror for the purpose of provoking revenge, but to awaken us from fatal and unmanly slumbers, that we may pursue determinately some fixed object.  It is not in the power of Britain or of Europe to conquer America, if she do not conquer herself by DELAY and TIMIDITY.  The present winter is worth an age if rightly employed, but if lost or neglected, the whole continent will partake of the misfortune; and there is no punishment which that man will not deserve, be he who, or what, or where he will, that may be the means of sacrificing a season so precious and useful. It is repugnant to reason, to the universal order of things, to all examples from former ages, to suppose, that this continent can longer remain subject to any external power. The most sanguine in Britain does not think so.  The utmost stretch of human wisdom cannot, at this time, compass a plan short of separation, which can promise the continent even a year's security.  Reconciliation is NOW a fallacious dream. Nature hath deserted the connection, and Art cannot supply her place.  For, as Milton wisely expresses, "never can true reconcilement grow, where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep." Every quiet method for peace hath been ineffectual.  Our prayers have been rejected with disdain; and only tended to convince us, that nothing flatters vanity, or confirms obstinacy in Kings more than repeated petitioning--and nothing hath contributed more than that very measure to make the Kings of Europe absolute: Witness Denmark and Sweden.  Wherefore, since nothing but blows will do, for God's sake, let us come to a final separation, and not leave the next generation to be cutting throats, under the violated unmeaning names of parent and child. To say, they will never attempt it again is idle and visionary, we thought so at the repeal of the stamp-act, yet a year
or two undeceived us; as well may we suppose that nations, which have been once defeated, will never renew the quarrel. As to government matters, it is not in the power of Britain to do this continent justice:  The business of it will soon be too weighty, and intricate, to be managed with any tolerable degree of convenience, by a power so distant from us, and so very ignorant of us; for if they cannot conquer us, they cannot govern us.  To be always running three or four thousand miles with a tale or a petition, waiting four or five months for an answer, which when obtained requires five or six more to explain it in, will in a few years be looked upon as folly and childishness--There was a time when it was proper, and there is a proper time for it to cease. Small islands not capable of protecting themselves, are the proper objects for kingdoms to take under their care; but there is something very absurd, in supposing a continent to be perpetually governed by an island.  In no instance hath nature made the satellite larger than its primary planet, and as England and America, with respect to each other, reverses the common order of nature, it is evident they belong to different systems; England to Europe, America to itself. I am not induced by motives of pride, party, or resentment to espouse the doctrine of separation and independance; I am clearly, positively, and conscientiously persuaded that it is the true interest of this continent to be so; that every thing short of THAT is mere patchwork, that it can afford no lasting felicity, --that it is leaving the sword to our children, and shrinking back at a time, when, a little more, a little farther, would have rendered this continent the glory of the earth. As Britain hath not manifested the least inclination towards a compromise, we may be assured that no terms can be obtained worthy the acceptance of the continent, or any ways equal to the expense of blood and treasure we have been already put to. The object, contended for, ought always to bear some just proportion to the expense.  The removal of North, or the whole detestable junto, is a matter unworthy the millions we have expended.  A temporary stoppage of trade, was an inconvenience, which would have sufficiently balanced the repeal of all the acts complained of, had such repeals been obtained; but if the whole continent must take up arms, if every man must be a soldier, it is scarcely worth our while to fight against a contemptible ministry only. Dearly, dearly, do we pay for the repeal of the acts, if that is all we fight for; for in a just estimation, it is as great a folly to pay a Bunker-hill price for law, as for land.  As I have always considered the independancy of this continent, as an event, which sooner or later must arrive, so from the late rapid progress of the continent to maturity, the event could not be far off.  Wherefore, on the breaking out of hostilities, it was not worth while to have disputed a matter, which time would have finally redressed, unless we meant to be in earnest; otherwise, it is like wasting an estate on a suit at law, to regulate the trespasses of a tenant, whose lease is just expiring.  No man was a warmer wisher for reconciliation than myself, before the fatal nineteenth of April 1775, but the moment the event of that day was made known, I rejected the hardened,
sullen tempered Pharaoh of England for ever; and disdain the wretch, that with the pretended title of FATHER OF HIS PEOPLE can unfeelingly hear of their slaughter, and composedly sleep with their blood upon his soul. But admitting that matters were now made up, what would be the event? I answer, the ruin of the continent.  And that for several reasons. FIRST.  The powers of governing still remaining in the hands of the king, he will have a negative over the whole legislation of this continent.  And as he hath shewn himself such an inveterate enemy to liberty, and discovered such a thirst for arbitrary power; is he, or is he not, a proper man to say to these colonies, "YOU SHALL MAKE NO LAWS BUT WHAT I PLEASE." And is there any inhabitant in America so ignorant as not to know, that according to what is called the PRESENT CONSTITUTION, that this continent can make no laws but what the king gives leave to; and is there any man so unwise, as not to see, that (considering what has happened) he will suffer no law to be made here, but such as suit HIS purpose.  We may be as effectually enslaved by the want of laws in America, as by submitting to laws made for us in England. After matters are made up (as it is called) can there be any doubt, but the whole power of the crown will be exerted, to keep this continent as low and humble as possible?  Instead of going forward we shall go backward, or be perpetually quarrelling or ridiculously petitioning. --WE are already greater than the king wishes us to be, and will he not hereafter endeavour to make us less?  To bring the matter to one point. Is the power who is jealous of our prosperity, a proper power to govern us? Whoever says No to this question, is an INDEPENDANT, for independancy means no more, than, whether we shall make our own laws, or whether the king, the greatest enemy this continent hath, or can have, shall tell us "THERE SHALL BE NO LAWS BUT SUCH AS I LIKE." But the king you will say has a negative in England; the people there can make no laws without his consent.  In point of right and good order, there is something very ridiculous, that a youth of twenty-one (which hath often happened) shall say to several millions of people, older and wiser than himself, I forbid this or that act of yours to be law. But in this place I decline this sort of reply, though I will never cease to expose the absurdity of it, and only answer, that England being the King's residence, and America not so, makes quite another case.  The king's negative HERE is ten times more dangerous and fatal than it can be in England, for THERE he will scarcely refuse his consent to a bill for putting England into as strong a state of defense as possible, and in America he would never suffer such a bill to be passed. America is only a secondary object in the system of British politics, England consults the good of THIS country, no farther than it answers her OWN purpose.  Wherefore, her own interest leads her to suppress the growth of OURS in every case which doth not promote her advantage, or in the least interferes with it.  A pretty state we should soon be in under such a secondhand government, considering what has happened! Men do not change from enemies to friends by the alteration of a name: And in order to shew that reconciliation now is a dangerous doctrine, I affirm, THAT IT WOULD BE POLICY IN THE KING AT THIS TIME, TO REPEAL THE ACTS FOR THE SAKE OF REINSTATING HIMSELF IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCES; in order, that HE MAY ACCOMPLISH BY CRAFT AND SUBTLETY, IN THE LONG RUN, WHAT HE CANNOT DO BY FORCE AND VIOLENCE IN THE SHORT ONE. Reconciliation and ruin are nearly related.
SECONDLY.  That as even the best terms, which we can expect to obtain, can amount to no more than a temporary expedient, or a kind of government by guardianship, which can last no longer than till the colonies come of age, so the general face and state of things, in the interim, will be unsettled and unpromising.  Emigrants of property will not choose to come to a country whose form of government hangs but by a thread, and who is every day tottering on the brink of commotion and disturbance; and numbers of the present inhabitants would lay hold of the interval, to dispense of their effects, and quit the continent. But the most powerful of all arguments, is, that nothing but independence, i.e.  a continental form of government, can keep the peace of the continent and preserve it inviolate from civil wars.  I dread the event of a reconciliation with Britain now, as it is more than probable, that it will be followed by a revolt somewhere or other, the consequences of which may be far more fatal than all the malice of Britain. Thousands are already ruined by British barbarity; (thousands more will probably suffer the same fate.) Those men have other feelings than us who have nothing suffered.  All they NOW possess is liberty, what they before enjoyed is sacrificed to its service, and having nothing more to lose, they disdain submission.  Besides, the general temper of the colonies, towards a British government, will be like that of a youth, who is nearly out of his time; they will care very little about her. And a government which cannot preserve the peace, is no government at all, and in that case we pay our money for nothing; and pray what is it that Britain can do, whose power will be wholly on paper, should a civil tumult break out the very day after reconciliation!  I have heard some men say, many of whom I believe spoke without thinking, that they dreaded an independence, fearing that it would produce civil wars. It is but seldom that our first thoughts are truly correct, and that is the case here; for there are ten times more to dread from a patched up connection than from independence.  I make the sufferers case my own, and I protest, that were I driven from house and home, my property destroyed, and my circumstances ruined, that as man, sensible of injuries, I could never relish the doctrine of reconciliation, or consider myself bound thereby. The colonies have manifested such a spirit of good order and obedience to continental government, as is sufficient to make every reasonable person easy and happy on that head.  No man can assign the least pretence for his fears, on any other grounds, than such as are truly childish and ridiculous, viz. that one colony will be striving for superiority over another. Where there are no distinctions there can be no superiority, perfect equality affords no temptation.  The republics of Europe are all (and we may say always) in peace.  Holland and Switzerland are without wars, foreign or domestic:  Monarchical governments, it is true, are never long at rest; the crown itself is a temptation to enterprising ruffians at HOME; and that degree of pride and insolence ever attendant on regal authority, swells into a rupture with foreign powers, in instances, where a republican government, by being formed on more natural principles, would negotiate the mistake. If there is any true cause of fear respecting independence, it is because no plan is yet laid down.  Men do not see their way out-Wherefore, as an opening into that business, I offer the following hints; at the same time modestly affirming, that I have no other opinion
of them myself, than that they may be the means of giving rise to something better.  Could the straggling thoughts of individuals be collected, they would frequently form materials for wise and able men to improve into useful matter. LET the assemblies be annual, with a President only. The representation more equal.  Their business wholly domestic, and subject to the authority of a Continental Congress. Let each colony be divided into six, eight, or ten, convenient districts, each district to send a proper number of delegates to Congress, so that each colony send at least thirty.  The whole number in Congress will be at least 390.  Each Congress to sit and to choose a president by the following method.  When the delegates are met, let a colony be taken from the whole thirteen colonies by lot, after which, let the whole Congress choose (by ballot) a president from out of the delegates of that province. In the next Congress, let a colony be taken by lot from twelve only, omitting that colony from which the president was taken in the former Congress, and so proceeding on till the whole thirteen shall have had their proper rotation. And in order that nothing may pass into a law but what is satisfactorily just not less than three fifths of the Congress to be called a majority-He that will promote discord, under a government so equally formed as this, would have joined Lucifer in his revolt. But as there is a peculiar delicacy, from whom, or in what manner, this business must first arise, and as it seems most agreeable and consistent, that it should come from some intermediate body between the governed and the governors, that is, between the Congress and the people.  Let a CONTINENTAL CONFERENCE be held, in the following manner, and for the following purpose. A committee of twenty-six members of Congress, viz. two for each colony. Two Members from each House of Assembly, or Provincial Convention; and five representatives of the people at large, to be chosen in the capital city or town of each province, for and in behalf of the whole province, by as many qualified voters as shall think proper to attend from all parts of the province for that purpose; or, if more convenient, the representatives may be chosen in two or three of the most populous parts thereof.  In this conference, thus assembled, will be united, the two grand principles of business KNOWLEDGE and POWER.  The members of Congress, Assemblies, or Conventions, by having had experience in national concerns, will be able and useful counsellors, and the whole, being empowered by the people, will have a truly legal authority. The conferring members being met, let their business be to frame a CONTINENTAL CHARTER, or Charter of the United Colonies; (answering to what is called the Magna Carta of England) fixing the number and manner of choosing members of Congress, members of Assembly, with their date of sitting, and drawing the line of business and jurisdiction between them:  (Always remembering, that our strength is continental, not provincial:)  Securing freedom and property to all men, and above all things, the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; with such other matter as is necessary for a charter to contain.  Immediately after which, the said Conference to dissolve, and the bodies which shall be chosen comformable to the said charter, to be the legislators and governors of this continent for the time being: Whose peace and happiness may God preserve, Amen. Should any body of men be hereafter delegated for this
or some similar purpose, I offer them the following extracts from that wise observer on governments DRAGONETTI. "The science" says he "of the politician consists in fixing the true point of happiness and freedom. Those men would deserve the gratitude of ages, who should discover a mode of government that contained the greatest sum of individual happiness, with the least national expense."  [Dragonetti on virtue and rewards] But where, says some, is the King of America? I'll tell you. Friend, he reigns above, and doth not make havoc of mankind like the Royal Brute of Britain.  Yet that we may not appear to be defective even in earthly honors, let a day be solemnly set apart for proclaiming the charter; let it be brought forth placed on the divine law, the word of God; let a crown be placed thereon, by which the world may know, that so far as we approve of monarchy, that in America THE LAW IS KING.  For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law OUGHT to be King; and there ought to be no other.  But lest any ill use should afterwards arise, let the crown at the conclusion of the ceremony, be demolished, and scattered among the people whose right it is. A government of our own is our natural right:  And when a man seriously reflects on the precariousness of human affairs, he will become convinced, that it is infinitely wiser and safer, to form a constitution of our own in a cool deliberate manner, while we have it in our power, than to trust such an interesting event to time and chance. If we omit it now, some [Thomas Anello otherwise Massanello a fisherman of Naples, who after spiriting up his countrymen in the public marketplace, against the oppressions of the Spaniards, to whom the place was then subject prompted them to revolt, and in the space of a day became king.]  Massanello may hereafter arise, who laying hold of popular disquietudes, may collect together the desperate and the discontented, and by assuming to themselves the powers of government, may sweep away the liberties of the continent like a deluge.  Should the government of America return again into the hands of Britain, the tottering situation of things will be a temptation for some desperate adventurer to try his fortune; and in such a case, that relief can Britain give? Ere she could hear the news, the fatal business might be done; and ourselves suffering like the wretched Britons under the oppression of the Conqueror.  Ye that oppose independence now, ye know not what ye do; ye are opening a door to eternal tyranny, by keeping vacant the seat of government.  There are thousands, and tens of thousands, who would think it glorious to expel from the continent that barbarous and hellish power, which hath stirred up the Indians and Negroes to destroy us; the cruelty hath a double guilt, it is dealing brutally by us, and treacherously by them. To talk of friendship with those in whom our reason forbids us to have faith, and our affections wounded through a thousand pores instruct us to detest, is madness and folly.  Every day wears out the little remains of kindred between us and them, and can there be any reason to hope, that as the relationship expires, the affection will increase, or that we shall agree better, when we have ten times more and greater concerns to quarrel over than ever? Ye that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye restore to us the time that is past?  Can ye give to prostitution its former innocence?
Neither can ye reconcile Britain and America.  The last cord now is broken, the people of England are presenting addresses against us. There are injuries which nature cannot forgive; she would cease to be nature if she did.  As well can the lover forgive the ravisher of his mistress, as the continent forgive the murders of Britain.  The Almighty hath implanted in us these unextinguishable feelings for good and wise purposes. They are the guardians of his image in our hearts.  They distinguish us from the herd of common animals.  The social compact would dissolve, and justice be extirpated the earth, or have only a casual existence were we callous to the touches of affection.  The robber, and the murderer, would often escape unpunished, did not the injuries which our tempers sustain, provoke us into justice. O ye that love mankind!  Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!  Every spot of the old world is overrun with oppression.  Freedom hath been hunted round the globe.  Asia, and Africa, have long expelled her--Europe regards her like a stranger, and England hath given her warning to depart.  O! receive the fugitive, and prepare in time an asylum for mankind.
OF THE PRESENT _ABILITY_ OF _AMERICA_, WITH SOME MISCELLANEOUS _REFLECTIONS_
I have never met with a man, either in England or America, who hath not confessed his opinion that a separation between the countries, would take place one time or other:  And there is no instance, in which we have shewn less judgement, than in endeavouring to describe, what we call the ripeness or fitness of the Continent for independence. As all men allow the measure, and vary only in their opinion of the time, let us, in order to remove mistakes, take a general survey of things, and endeavour, if possible, to find out the VERY time.  But we need not go far, the inquiry ceases at once, for, the TIME HATH FOUND US. The general concurrence, the glorious union of all things prove the fact. It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies; yet our present numbers are sufficient to repel the force of all the world. The Continent hath, at this time, the largest body of armed and disciplined men of any power under Heaven; and is just arrived at that pitch of strength, in which no single colony is able to support itself, and the whole, when united, can accomplish the matter, and either more, or, less than this, might be fatal in its effects.  Our land force is already sufficient, and as to naval affairs, we cannot be insensible, that Britain would never suffer an American man of war to be built, while the continent remained in her hands.  Wherefore, we should be no forwarder an hundred years hence in that branch, than we are now; but the truth is, we should be less so, because the timber of the country is every day diminishing, and that, which will remain at last, will be far off and difficult to procure. Were the continent crowded with inhabitants, her sufferings under the present circumstances would be intolerable.  The more seaport towns we had, the more should we have both to defend and to lose.  Our present numbers are so happily proportioned to our wants, that no man need be idle.
The diminution of trade affords an army, and the necessities of an army create a new trade. Debts we have none; and whatever we may contract on this account will serve as a glorious memento of our virtue.  Can we but leave posterity with a settled form of government, an independent constitution of its own, the purchase at any price will be cheap.  But to expend millions for the sake of getting a few vile acts repealed, and routing the present ministry only, is unworthy the charge, and is using posterity with the utmost cruelty; because it is leaving them the great work to do, and a debt upon their backs, from which they derive no advantage.  Such a thought is unworthy of a man of honor, and is the true characteristic of a narrow heart and a peddling politician. The debt we may contract doth not deserve our regard, if the work be but accomplished.  No nation ought to be without a debt. A national debt is a national bond; and when it bears no interest, is in no case a grievance.  Britain is oppressed with a debt of upwards of one hundred and forty millions sterling, for which she pays upwards of four millions interest.  And as a compensation for her debt, she has a large navy; America is without a debt, and without a navy; yet for the twentieth part of the English national debt, could have a navy as large again.  The navy of England is not worth, at this time, more than three millions and an half sterling. The first and second editions of this pamphlet were published without the following calculations, which are now given as a proof that the above estimation of the navy is just. [See Entic's naval history, intro.  page 56.] The charge of building a ship of each rate, and furnishing her with masts, yards, sails and rigging, together with a proportion of eight months boatswain's and carpenter's seastores, as calculated by Mr. Burchett, Secretary to the navy.                                [pounds Sterling]  For a ship of a 100 guns    -   35,553            90   -            -   29,886            80   -            -   23,638            70   -            -   17,795            60   -            -   14,197            50   -            -   10,606            40   -            -    7,558            30   -            -    5,846            20   -            -    3,710
And from hence it is easy to sum up the value, or cost rather, of the whole British navy, which in the year 1757, when it was at its greatest glory consisted of the following ships and guns:
   Ships.      Guns.     Cost of one.        Cost of all    6     -   100   -    35,553    -         213,318   12     -    90   -    29,886    -         358,632   12     -    80   -    23,638    -         283,656   43     -    70   -    17,785    -         764,755   35     -    60   -    14,197    -         496,895   40     -    50   -    10,606    -         424,240
   45     -    40   -     7,558    -         340,110   58     -    20   -     3,710    -         215,180   85 Sloops, bombs,     and fireships, one     2,000            170,000     with another,                         _________                                     Cost  3,266,786     Remains for guns,    _________          233,214                                           _________                                           3,500,000
No country on the globe is so happily situated, or so internally capable of raising a fleet as America.  Tar, timber, iron, and cordage are her natural produce.  We need go abroad for nothing.  Whereas the Dutch, who make large profits by hiring out their ships of war to the Spaniards and Portuguese, are obliged to import most of their materials they use. We ought to view the building a fleet as an article of commerce, it being the natural manufactory of this country.  It is the best money we can lay out. A navy when finished is worth more than it cost.  And is that nice point in national policy, in which commerce and protection are united.  Let us build; if we want them not, we can sell; and by that means replace our paper currency with ready gold and silver. In point of manning a fleet, people in general run into great errors; it is not necessary that one fourth part should he sailors. The Terrible privateer, Captain Death, stood the hottest engagement of any ship last war, yet had not twenty sailors on board, though her complement of men was upwards of two hundred. A few able and social sailors will soon instruct a sufficient number of active landmen in the common work of a ship.  Wherefore, we never can be more capable to begin on maritime matters than now, while our timber is standing, our fisheries blocked up, and our sailors and shipwrights out of employ.  Men of war of seventy and eighty guns were built forty years ago in New-England, and why not the same now?  Ship-building is America's greatest pride, and in which she will in time excel the whole world. The great empires of the east are mostly inland, and consequently excluded from the possibility of rivalling her. Africa is in a state of barbarism; and no power in Europe hath either such an extent of coast, or such an internal supply of materials. Where nature hath given the one, she has withheld the other; to America only hath she been liberal of both.  The vast empire of Russia is almost shut out from the sea: wherefore, her boundless forests, her tar, iron, and cordage are only articles of commerce. In point of safety, ought we to be without a fleet?  We are not the little people now, which we were sixty years ago; at that time we might have trusted our property in the streets, or fields rather; and slept securely without locks or bolts to our doors or windows.  The case now is altered, and our methods of defense ought to improve with our increase of property.  A common pirate, twelve months ago, might have come up the Delaware, and laid the city of Philadelphia under instant contribution, for what sum he pleased; and the same might have happened to other places. Nay, any daring fellow, in a brig of fourteen or sixteen guns might have robbed the whole continent, and carried off half a million of money. These are circumstances which demand our attention, and point out the necessity of naval protection.
Some, perhaps, will say, that after we have made it up with Britain, she will protect us.  Can we be so unwise as to mean, that she shall keep a navy in our harbours for that purpose? Common sense will tell us, that the power which hath endeavoured to subdue us, is of all others the most improper to defend us. Conquest may be effected under the pretence of friendship; and ourselves after a long and brave resistance, be at last cheated into slavery.  And if her ships are not to be admitted into our harbours, I would ask, how is she to protect us?  A navy three or four thousand miles off can be of little use, and on sudden emergencies, none at all. Wherefore, if we must hereafter protect ourselves, why not do it for ourselves? The English list of ships of war, is long and formidable, but not a tenth part of them are at any one time fit for service, numbers of them not in being; yet their names are pompously continued in the list, if only a plank be left of the ship: and not a fifth part of such as are fit for service, can be spared on any one station at one time. The East and West Indies, Mediterranean, Africa, and other parts over which Britain extends her claim, make large demands upon her navy. From a mixture of prejudice and inattention, we have contracted a false notion respecting the navy of England, and have talked as if we should have the whole of it to encounter at once, and for that reason, supposed, that we must have one as large; which not being instantly practicable, have been made use of by a set of disguised Tories to discourage our beginning thereon.  Nothing can be farther from truth than this; for if America had only a twentieth part of the naval force of Britain, she would be by far an overmatch for her; because, as we neither have, nor claim any foreign dominion, our whole force would be employed on our own coast, where we should, in the long run, have two to one the advantage of those who had three or four thousand miles to sail over, before they could attack us, and the same distance to return in order to refit and recruit.  And although Britain, by her fleet, hath a check over our trade to Europe, we have as large a one over her trade to the West Indies, which, by laying in the neighbourhood of the continent, is entirely at its mercy. Some method might be fallen on to keep up a naval force in time of peace, if we should not judge it necessary to support a constant navy. If premiums were to be given to merchants, to build and employ in their service ships mounted with twenty, thirty, forty or fifty guns, (the premiums to be in proportion to the loss of bulk to the merchants) fifty or sixty of those ships, with a few guardships on constant duty, would keep up a sufficient navy, and that without burdening ourselves with the evil so loudly complained of in England, of suffering their fleet, in time of peace to lie rotting in the docks.  To unite the sinews of commerce and defense is sound policy; for when our strength and our riches play into each other's hand, we need fear no external enemy. In almost every article of defense we abound.  Hemp flourishes even to rankness, so that we need not want cordage.  Our iron is superior to that of other countries.  Our small arms equal to any in the world. Cannon we can cast at pleasure.  Saltpetre and gunpowder we are every day producing.  Our knowledge is hourly improving.  Resolution is our inherent character, and courage hath never yet forsaken us.  Wherefore, what is it that we want?  Why is it that we hesitate?  From Britain we can expect nothing but ruin.  If she is once admitted to the government of America again, this Continent will not be worth living in. Jealousies will be always arising; insurrections will be constantly happening; and who will go forth to quell them?  Who will venture his life to reduce his
own countrymen to a foreign obedience?  The difference between Pennsylvania and Connecticut, respecting some unlocated lands, shews the insignificance of a British government, and fully proves, that nothing but Continental authority can regulate Continental matters. Another reason why the present time is preferable to all others, is, that the fewer our numbers are, the more land there is yet unoccupied, which instead of being lavished by the king on his worthless dependants, may be hereafter applied, not only to the discharge of the present debt, but to the constant support of government.  No nation under heaven hath such an advantage at this. The infant state of the Colonies, as it is called, so far from being against, is an argument in favour of independance. We are sufficiently numerous, and were we more so, we might be less united. It is a matter worthy of observation, that the more a country is peopled, the smaller their armies are.  In military numbers, the ancients far exceeded the modems: and the reason is evident.  For trade being the consequence of population, men become too much absorbed thereby to attend to anything else.  Commerce diminishes the spirit, both of patriotism and military defence.  And history sufficiently informs us, that the bravest achievements were always accomplished in the non-age of a nation. With the increase of commerce, England hath lost its spirit.  The city of London, notwithstanding its numbers, submits to continued insults with the patience of a coward.  The more men have to lose, the less willing are they to venture.  The rich are in general slaves to fear, and submit to courtly power with the trembling duplicity of a Spaniel. Youth is the seed time of good habits, as well in nations as in individuals. It might be difficult, if not impossible, to form the Continent into one government half a century hence.  The vast variety of interests, occasioned by an increase of trade and population, would create confusion. Colony would be against colony.  Each being able might scorn each other's assistance: and while the proud and foolish gloried in their little distinctions, the wise would lament, that the union had not been formed before. Wherefore, the PRESENT TIME is the TRUE TIME for establishing it. The intimacy which is contracted in infancy, and the friendship which is formed in misfortune, are, of all others, the most lasting and unalterable. Our present union is marked with both these characters: we are young and we have been distressed; but our concord hath withstood our troubles, and fixes a memorable area for posterity to glory in. The present time, likewise, is that peculiar time, which never happens to a nation but once, viz. the time of forming itself into a government. Most nations have let slip the opportunity, and by that means have been compelled to receive laws from their conquerors, instead of making laws for themselves.  First, they had a king, and then a form of government; whereas, the articles or charter of government, should be formed first, and men delegated to execute them afterward but from the errors of other nations, let us learn wisdom, and lay hold of the present opportunity --TO BEGIN GOVERNMENT AT THE RIGHT END. When William the Conqueror subdued England, he gave them law at the point of the sword; and until we consent, that the seat of government, in America, be legally and authoritatively occupied, we shall be in danger of having it filled by some fortunate ruffian, who may treat us in the same manner, and then, where will be our freedom? where our property? As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of all government, to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I know of no other
business which government hath to do therewith, Let a man throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of principle, which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to part with, and he will be at delivered of his fears on that head.  Suspicion is the companion of mean souls, and the bane of all good society.  For myself, I fully and conscientiously believe, that it is the will of the Almighty, that there should be diversity of religious opinions among us: It affords a larger field for our Christian kindness.  Were we all of one way of thinking, our religious dispositions would want matter for probation; and on this liberal principle, I look on the various denominations among us, to be like children of the same family, differing only, in what is called, their Christian names. In page forty, I threw out a few thoughts on the propriety of a Continental Charter, (for I only presume to offer hints, not plans) and in this place, I take the liberty of rementioning the subject, by observing, that a charter is to be understood as a bond of solemn obligation, which the whole enters into, to support the right of every separate part, whether of religion, personal freedom, or property. A firm bargain and a right reckoning make long friends. In a former page I likewise mentioned the necessity of a large and equal representation; and there is no political matter which more deserves our attention.  A small number of electors, or a small number of representatives, are equally dangerous. But if the number of the representatives be not only small, but unequal, the danger is increased.  As an instance of this, I mention the following; when the Associators petition was before the House of Assembly of Pennsylvania; twenty-eight members only were present, all the Bucks county members, being eight, voted against it, and had seven of the Chester members done the same, this whole province had been governed by two counties only, and this danger it is always exposed to. The unwarrantable stretch likewise, which that house made in their last sitting, to gain an undue authority over the delegates of that province, ought to warn the people at large, how they trust power out of their own hands.  A set of instructions for the Delegates were put together, which in point of sense and business would have dishonoured a schoolboy, and after being approved by a FEW, a VERY FEW without doors, were carried into the House, and there passed IN BEHALF OF THE WHOLE COLONY; whereas, did the whole colony know, with what ill-will that House hath entered on some necessary public measures, they would not hesitate a moment to think them unworthy of such a trust. Immediate necessity makes many things convenient, which if continued would grow into oppressions.  Expedience and right are different things. When the calamities of America required a consultation, there was no method so ready, or at that time so proper, as to appoint persons from the several Houses of Assembly for that purpose; and the wisdom with which they have proceeded hath preserved this continent from ruin. But as it is more than probable that we shall never be without a CONGRESS, every well wisher to good order, must own, that the mode for choosing members of that body, deserves consideration.  And I put it as a question to those, who make a study of mankind, whether representation and election is not too great a power for one and the same body of men to possess?  When we are planning for posterity, we ought to remember, that virtue is not hereditary. It is from our enemies that we often gain excellent maxims, and are frequently surprised into reason by their mistakes, Mr. Cornwall
(one of the Lords of the Treasury) treated the petition of the New-York Assembly with contempt, because THAT House, he said, consisted but of twenty-six members, which trifling number, he argued, could not with decency be put for the whole.  We thank him for his involuntary honesty. [Those who would fully understand of what great consequence a large and equal representation is to a state, should read Burgh's political disquisitions.]
TO CONCLUDE, however strange it may appear to some, or however unwilling they may be to think so, matters not, but many strong and striking reasons may be given, to shew, that nothing can settle our affairs so expeditiously as an open and determined declaration for independance. Some of which are, FIRST. -- It is the custom of nations, when any two are at war, for some other powers, not engaged in the quarrel, to step in as mediators, and bring about the preliminaries of a peace: but while America calls herself the Subject of Great Britain, no power, however well disposed she may be, can offer her mediation.  Wherefore, in our present state we may quarrel on for ever. SECONDLY. -- It is unreasonable to suppose, that France or Spain will give us any kind of assistance, if we mean only, to make use of that assistance for the purpose of repairing the breach, and strengthening the connection between Britain and America; because, those powers would be sufferers by the consequences. THIRDLY. -- While we profess ourselves the subjects of Britain, we must, in the eye of foreign nations, be considered as rebels.  The precedent is somewhat dangerous to THEIR PEACE, for men to be in arms under the name of subjects; we, on the spot, can solve the paradox: but to unite resistance and subjection, requires an idea much too refined for common understanding. FOURTHLY. -- Were a manifesto to be published, and despatched to foreign courts, setting forth the miseries we have endured, and the peaceable methods we have ineffectually used for redress; declaring, at the same time, that not being able, any longer, to live happily or safely under the cruel disposition of the British court, we had been driven to the necessity of breaking off all connections with her; at the same time, assuring all such courts of our peaceable disposition towards them, and of our desire of entering into trade with them: Such a memorial would produce more good effects to this Continent, than if a ship were freighted with petitions to Britain. Under our present denomination of British subjects, we can neither be received nor heard abroad: The custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independance, we take rank with other nations. These proceedings may at first appear strange and difficult; but, like all other steps which we have already passed over, will in a little time become familiar and agreeable; and, until an independance is declared, the Continent will feel itself like a man who continues putting off some unpleasant business from day to day, yet knows it must be done, hates to set about it, wishes it over, and is continually haunted with the thoughts of its necessity.
                            APPENDIX
Since the publication of the first edition of this pamphlet, or rather, on the same day on which it came out, the King's Speech made its appearance in this city.  Had the spirit of prophecy directed the birth of this production, it could not have brought it forth, at a more seasonable juncture, or a more necessary time. The bloody mindedness of the one, shew the necessity of pursuing the doctrine of the other.  Men read by way of revenge. And the Speech, instead of terrifying, prepared a way for the manly principles of Independance. Ceremony, and even, silence, from whatever motive they may arise, have a hurtful tendency, when they give the least degree of countenance to base and wicked performances; wherefore, if this maxim be admitted, it naturally follows, that the King's Speech, as being a piece of finished villany, deserved, and still deserves, a general execration both by the Congress and the people.  Yet, as the domestic tranquillity of a nation, depends greatly, on the CHASTITY of what may properly be called NATIONAL MANNERS, it is often better, to pass some things over in silent disdain, than to make use of such new methods of dislike, as might introduce the least innovation, on that guardian of our peace and safety.  And, perhaps, it is chiefly owing to this prudent delicacy, that the King's Speech, hath not, before now, suffered a public execution. The Speech if it may be called one, is nothing better than a wilful audacious libel against the truth, the common good, and the existence of mankind; and is a formal and pompous method of offering up human sacrifices to the pride of tyrants. But this general massacre of mankind.  is one of the privileges, and the certain consequence of Kings; for as nature knows them NOT, they know NOT HER, and although they are beings of our OWN creating, they know not US, and are become the gods of their creators. The Speech hath one good quality, which is, that it is not calculated to deceive, neither can we, even if we would, be deceived by it. Brutality and tyranny appear on the face of it.  It leaves us at no loss: And every line convinces, even in the moment of reading, that He, who hunts the woods for prey, the naked and untutored Indian, is less a Savage than the King of Britain. Sir John Dalrymple, the putative father of a whining jesuitical piece, fallaciously called, "THE ADDRESS OF THE PEOPLE OF _ENGLAND_ TO THE INHABITANTS OF _AMERICA_," hath, perhaps, from a vain supposition, that the people here were to be frightened at the pomp and description of a king, given, (though very unwisely on his part) the real character of the present one:  "But" says this writer, "if you are inclined to pay compliments to an administration, which we do not complain of," (meaning the Marquis of Rockingham's at the repeal of the Stamp Act) "it is very unfair in you to withhold them from that prince by WHOSE _NOD ALONE_ THEY WERE PERMITTED TO DO ANY THING." This is toryism with a witness!  Here is idolatry even without a mask: And he who can calmly hear, and digest such doctrine, hath forfeited his claim to rationality an apostate from the order of manhood; and ought to be considered as one, who hath not only given up the proper dignity of man, but sunk himself beneath the rank of animals, and contemptibly crawl through the world like a worm.
However, it matters very little now, what the king of England either says or does; he hath wickedly broken through every moral and human obligation, trampled nature and conscience beneath his feet; and by a steady and constitutional spirit of insolence and cruelty, procured for himself an universal hatred.  It is NOW the interest of America to provide for herself. She hath already a large and young family, whom it is more her duty to take care of, than to be granting away her property, to support a power who is become a reproach to the names of men and christians--YE, whose office it is to watch over the morals of a nation, of whatsoever sect or denomination ye are of, as well as ye, who, are more immediately the guardians of the public liberty, if ye wish to preserve your native country uncontaminated by European corruption, ye must in secret wish a separation--But leaving the moral part to private reflection, I shall chiefly confine my farther remarks to the following heads. First.  That it is the interest of America to be separated from Britain. Secondly.  Which is the easiest and most practicable plan, RECONCILIATION OR INDEPENDANCE? With some occasional remarks. In support of the first, I could, if I judged it proper, produce the opinion of some of the ablest and most experienced men on this continent; and whose sentiments, on that head, are not yet publicly known.  It is in reality a self-evident position: For no nation in a state of foreign dependance, limited in its commerce, and cramped and fettered in its legislative powers, can ever arrive at any material eminence.  America doth not yet know what opulence is; and although the progress which she hath made stands unparalleled in the history of other nations, it is but childhood, compared with what she would be capable of arriving at, had she, as she ought to have, the legislative powers in her own hands. England is, at this time, proudly coveting what would do her no good, were she to accomplish it; and the Continent hesitating on a matter, which will be her final ruin if neglected.  It is the commerce and not the conquest of America, by which England is to be benefited, and that would in a great measure continue, were the countries as independant of each other as France and Spain; because in many articles, neither can go to a better market.  But it is the independance of this country of Britain or any other, which is now the main and only object worthy of contention, and which, like all other truths discovered by necessity, will appear clearer and stronger every day. First.  Because it will come to that one time or other. Secondly.  Because, the longer it is delayed the harder it will be to accomplish. I have frequently amused myself both in public and private companies, with silently remarking, the specious errors of those who speak without reflecting.  And among the many which I have heard, the following seems the most general, viz. that had this rupture happened forty or fifty years hence, instead of NOW, the Continent would have been more able to have shaken off the dependance.  To which I reply, that our military ability, AT THIS TIME, arises from the experience gained in the last war, and which in forty or fifty years time,
would have been totally extinct.  The Continent, would not, by that time, have had a General, or even a military officer left; and we, or those who may succeed us, would have been as ignorant of martial matters as the ancient Indians:  And this single position, closely attended to, will unanswerably prove, that the present time is preferable to all others.  The argument turns thus--at the conclusion of the last war, we had experience, but wanted numbers; and forty or fifty years hence, we should have numbers, without experience; wherefore, the proper point of time, must be some particular point between the two extremes, in which a sufficiency of the former remains, and a proper increase of the latter is obtained:  And that point of time is the present time. The reader will pardon this digression, as it does not properly come under the head I first set out with, and to which I again return by the following position, viz. Should affairs be patched up with Britain, and she to remain the governing and sovereign power of America, (which, as matters are now circumstanced, is giving up the point entirely) we shall deprive ourselves of the very means of sinking the debt we have, or may contract.  The value of the back lands which some of the provinces are clandestinely deprived of, by the unjust extension of the limits of Canada, valued only at five pounds sterling per hundred acres, amount to upwards of twenty-five millions, Pennsylvania currency; and the quit-rents at one penny sterling per acre, to two millions yearly. It is by the sale of those lands that the debt may be sunk, without burthen to any, and the quit-rent reserved thereon, will always lessen, and in time, will wholly support the yearly expence of government.  It matters not how long the debt is in paying, so that the lands when sold be applied to the discharge of it, and for the execution of which, the Congress for the time being, will be the continental trustees. I proceed now to the second head, viz.  Which is the easiest and most practicable plan, RECONCILIATION or INDEPENDANCE; With some occasional remarks. He who takes nature for his guide is not easily beaten out of his argument, and on that ground, I answer GENERALLY--THAT _INDEPENDANCE_ BEING A _SINGLE SIMPLE LINE,_ CONTAINED WITHIN OURSELVES; AND RECONCILIATION, A MATTER EXCEEDINGLY PERPLEXED AND COMPLICATED, AND IN WHICH, A TREACHEROUS CAPRICIOUS COURT IS TO INTERFERE, GIVES THE ANSWER WITHOUT A DOUBT. The present state of America is truly alarming to every man who is capable of reflexion.  Without law, without government, without any other mode of power than what is founded on, and granted by courtesy. Held together by an unexampled concurrence of sentiment, which, is nevertheless subject to change, and which, every secret enemy is endeavouring to dissolve.  Our present condition, is, Legislation without law; wisdom without a plan; a constitution without a name; and, what is strangely astonishing, perfect Independance contending for dependance.  The instance is without a precedent; the case never existed before; and who can tell what may be the event?  The property of no man is secure in the present unbraced system of things.  The mind of the multitude is left at random, and seeing no fixed object before
them, they pursue such as fancy or opinion starts.  Nothing is criminal; there is no such thing as treason; wherefore, every one thinks himself at liberty to act as he pleases.  The Tories dared not have assembled offensively, had they known that their lives, by that act, were forfeited to the laws of the state.  A line of distinction should be drawn, between, English soldiers taken in battle, and inhabitants of America taken in arms. The first are prisoners, but the latter traitors. The one forfeits his liberty, the other his head. Notwithstanding our wisdom, there is a visible feebleness in some of our proceedings which gives encouragement to dissensions. The Continental Belt is too loosely buckled.  And if something is not done in time, it will be too late to do any thing, and we shall fall into a state, in which, neither RECONCILIATION nor INDEPENDANCE will be practicable.  The king and his worthless adherents are got at their old game of dividing the Continent, and there are not wanting among us, Printers, who will be busy in spreading specious falsehoods.  The artful and hypocritical letter which appeared a few months ago in two of the New York papers, and likewise in two others, is an evidence that there are men who want either judgment or honesty. It is easy getting into holes and corners and talking of reconciliation: But do such men seriously consider, how difficult the task is, and how dangerous it may prove, should the Continent divide thereon.  Do they take within their view, all the various orders of men whose situation and circumstances, as well as their own, are to be considered therein. Do they put themselves in the place of the sufferer whose ALL is ALREADY gone, and of the soldier, who hath quitted ALL for the defence of his country.  If their ill judged moderation be suited to their own private situations only, regardless of others, the event will convince them, that "they are reckoning without their Host." Put us, says some, on the footing we were on in sixty-three: To which I answer, the request is not now in the power of Britain to comply with, neither will she propose it; but if it were, and even should be granted, I ask, as a reasonable question, By what means is such a corrupt and faithless court to be kept to its engagements?  Another parliament, nay, even the present, may hereafter repeal the obligation, on the pretense, of its being violently obtained, or unwisely granted; and in that case, Where is our redress?--No going to law with nations; cannon are the barristers of Crowns; and the sword, not of justice, but of war, decides the suit. To be on the footing of sixty-three, it is not sufficient, that the laws only be put on the same state, but, that our circumstances, likewise, be put on the same state; Our burnt and destroyed towns repaired or built up, our private losses made good, our public debts (contracted for defence) discharged; otherwise, we shall be millions worse than we were at that enviable period.  Such a request, had it been complied with a year ago, would have won the heart and soul of the Continent--but now it is too late, "The Rubicon is passed." Besides, the taking up arms, merely to enforce the repeal of a pecuniary law, seems as unwarrantable by the divine law, and as repugnant to human feelings, as the taking up arms to enforce obedience thereto.  The object, on either side, doth not justify the means; for the lives of men are too valuable to be cast away on such trifles.  It is the violence which is done
and threatened to our persons; the destruction of our property by an armed force; the invasion of our country by fire and sword, which conscientiously qualifies the use of arms: And the instant, in which such a mode of defence became necessary, all subjection to Britain ought to have ceased; and the independancy of America, should have been considered, as dating its aera from, and published by, THE FIRST MUSKET THAT WAS FIRED AGAINST HER.  This line is a line of consistency; neither drawn by caprice, nor extended by ambition; but produced by a chain of events, of which the colonies were not the authors. I shall conclude these remarks with the following timely and well intended hints.  We ought to reflect, that there are three different ways by which an independancy may hereafter be effected; and that ONE of those THREE, will one day or other, be the fate of America, viz.  By the legal voice of the people in Congress; by a military power; or by a mob--It may not always happen that OUR soldiers are citizens, and the multitude a body of reasonable men; virtue, as I have already remarked, is not hereditary, neither is it perpetual.  Should an independancy be brought about by the first of those means, we have every opportunity and every encouragement before us, to form the noblest purest constitution on the face of the earth.  We have it in our power to begin the world over again.  A situation, similar to the present, hath not happened since the days of Noah until now.  The birthday of a new world is at hand, and a race of men, perhaps as numerous as all Europe contains, are to receive their portion of freedom from the event of a few months. The Reflexion is awful--and in this point of view, How trifling, how ridiculous, do the little, paltry cavillings, of a few weak or interested men appear, when weighed against the business of a world. Should we neglect the present favourable and inviting period, and an Independance be hereafter effected by any other means, we must charge the consequence to ourselves, or to those rather, whose narrow and prejudiced souls, are habitually opposing the measure, without either inquiring or reflecting.  There are reasons to be given in support of Independance, which men should rather privately think of, than be publicly told of.  We ought not now to be debating whether we shall be independant or not, but, anxious to accomplish it on a firm, secure, and honorable basis, and uneasy rather that it is not yet began upon. Every day convinces us of its necessity.  Even the Tories (if such beings yet remain among us) should, of all men, be the most solicitous to promote it; for, as the appointment of committees at first, protected them from popular rage, so, a wise and well established form of government, will be the only certain means of continuing it securely to them. WHEREFORE, if they have not virtue enough to be WHIGS, they ought to have prudence enough to wish for Independance. In short, Independance is the only BOND that can tye and keep us together.  We shall then see our object, and our ears will be legally shut against the schemes of an intriguing, as well, as a cruel enemy.  We shall then too, be on a proper footing, to treat with Britain; for there is reason to conclude, that the pride of that court, will be less hurt by treating with the American states for terms of peace, than with those, whom she denominates, "rebellious subjects," for terms of accommodation. It is our delaying it that encourages her to hope for conquest, and our backwardness tends only to prolong the war.  As we have, without any good effect therefrom, withheld our trade to obtain a redress of our grievances,
let us now try the alternative, by independantly redressing them ourselves, and then offering to open the trade.  The mercantile and reasonable part in England, will be still with us; because, peace with trade, is preferable to war without it.  And if this offer be not accepted, other courts may be applied to. On these grounds I rest the matter.  And as no offer hath yet been made to refute the doctrine contained in the former editions of this pamphlet, it is a negative proof, that either the doctrine cannot be refuted, or, that the party in favour of it are too numerous to be opposed.  WHEREFORE, instead of gazing at each other with suspicious or doubtful curiosity; let each of us, hold out to his neighbour the hearty hand of friendship, and unite in drawing a line, which, like an act of oblivion shall bury in forgetfulness every former dissension. Let the names of Whig and Tory be extinct; and let none other be heard among us, than those of A GOOD CITIZEN, AN OPEN AND RESOLUTE FRIEND, AND A VIRTUOUS SUPPORTER OF THE RIGHTS OF MANKIND AND OF THE _FREE AND INDEPENDANT STATES OF AMERICA_. To the Representatives of the Religious Society of the People called Quakers, or to so many of them as were concerned in publishing the late piece, entitled "THE ANCIENT TESTIMONY and PRINCIPLES of the People called QUAKERS renewed, with Respect to the KING and GOVERNMENT, and touching the COMMOTIONS now prevailing in these and other parts of AMERICA addressed to the PEOPLE IN GENERAL." The Writer of this, is one of those few, who never dishonours religion either by ridiculing, or cavilling at any denomination whatsoever. To God, and not to man, are all men accountable on the score of religion. Wherefore, this epistle is not so properly addressed to you as a religious, but as a political body, dabbling in matters, which the professed Quietude of your Principles instruct you not to meddle with.  As you have, without a proper authority for so doing, put yourselves in the place of the whole body of the Quakers, so, the writer of this, in order to be on an equal rank with yourselves, is under the necessity, of putting himself in the place of all those, who, approve the very writings and principles, against which, your testimony is directed:  And he hath chosen this singular situation, in order, that you might discover in him that presumption of character which you cannot see in yourselves.  For neither he nor you can have any claim or title to POLITICAL REPRESENTATION. When men have departed from the right way, it is no wonder that they stumble and fall.  And it is evident from the manner in which ye have managed your testimony, that politics, (as a religious body of men) is not your proper Walk; for however well adapted it might appear to you, it is, nevertheless, a jumble of good and bad put unwisely together, and the conclusion drawn therefrom, both unnatural and unjust. The two first pages, (and the whole doth not make four) we give you credit for, and expect the same civility from you, because the love and desire of peace is not confined to Quakerism, it is the natural, as well the religious wish of all denominations of men.  And on this ground, as men labouring to establish an Independant Constitution of our own, do we exceed all others in our hope, end, and aim.  OUR PLAN IS PEACE FOR EVER. We are tired of contention with Britain, and can see no real end to it but in a final separation.  We act consistently, because for the sake of introducing an endless and uninterrupted peace, do we bear the evils
and burthens of the present day.  We are endeavoring, and will steadily continue to endeavour, to separate and dissolve a connexion which hath already filled our land with blood; and which, while the name of it remains, will be the fatal cause of future mischiefs to both countries. We fight neither for revenge nor conquest; neither from pride nor passion; we are not insulting the world with our fleets and armies, nor ravaging the globe for plunder.  Beneath the shade of our own vines are we attacked; in our own houses, and on our own lands, is the violence committed against us.  We view our enemies in the character of Highwaymen and Housebreakers, and having no defence for ourselves in the civil law, are obliged to punish them by the military one, and apply the sword, in the very case, where you have before now, applied the halter-Perhaps we feel for the ruined and insulted sufferers in all and every part of the continent, with a degree of tenderness which hath not yet made its way into some of your bosoms.  But be ye sure that ye mistake not the cause and ground of your Testimony.  Call not coldness of soul, religion; nor put the BIGOT in the place of the CHRISTIAN. O ye partial ministers of your own acknowledged principles.  If the bearing arms be sinful, the first going to war must be more so, by all the difference between wilful attack, and unavoidable defence. Wherefore, if ye really preach from conscience, and mean not to make a political hobbyhorse of your  religion convince the world thereof, by proclaiming your doctrine to our enemies, FOR THEY LIKEWISE BEAR _ARMS_. Give us proof of your sincerity by publishing it at St. James's, to the commanders in chief at Boston, to the Admirals and Captains who are piratically ravaging our coasts, and to all the murdering miscreants who are acting in authority under HIM whom ye profess to serve. Had ye the honest soul of BARCLAY ye would preach repentance to YOUR king; Ye would tell the Royal Wretch his sins, and warn him of eternal ruin. ["Thou hast tasted of prosperity and adversity; thou knowest what it is to be banished thy native country, to be over-ruled as well as to rule, and set upon the throne; and being oppressed thou hast reason to know how hateful the oppressor is both to God and man:  If after all these warnings and advertisements, thou dost not turn unto the Lord with all thy heart, but forget him who remembered thee in thy distress, and give up thyself to fallow lust and vanity, surely great will be thy condemnation.-Against which snare, as well as the temptation of those who may or do feed thee, and prompt thee to evil, the most excellent and prevalent remedy will be, to apply thyself to that light of Christ which shineth in thy conscience, and which neither can, nor will flatter thee, nor suffer thee to be at ease in thy sins."--Barclay's address to Charles II.] Ye would not spend your partial invectives against the injured and the insulted only, but, like faithful ministers, would cry aloud and SPARE NONE.  Say not that ye are persecuted, neither endeavour to make us the authors of that reproach, which, ye are bringing upon yourselves; for we testify unto all men, that we do not complain against you because ye are Quakers, but because ye pretend to be and are NOT Quakers. Alas! it seems by the particular tendency of some part of your testimony, and other parts of your conduct, as if, all sin was reduced to, and comprehended in, THE ACT OF BEARING ARMS, and that by the people only. Ye appear to us, to have mistaken party for conscience; because, the general tenor of your actions wants uniformity--And it is exceedingly difficult to us to give credit to many of your pretended scruples; because, we see them made by the same men, who, in the very instant that they are exclaiming against the mammon of this world, are nevertheless, hunting after it with a step as steady as Time, and an appetite as keen
as Death. The quotation which ye have made from Proverbs, in the third page of your testimony, that, "when a man's ways please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him"; is very unwisely chosen on your part; because, it amounts to a proof, that the king's ways (whom ye are desirous of supporting) do NOT please the Lord, otherwise, his reign would be in peace. I now proceed to the latter part of your testimony, and that, for which all the foregoing seems only an introduction viz. "It hath ever been our judgment and principle, since we were called to profess the light of Christ Jesus, manifested in our consciences unto this day, that the setting up and putting down kings and governments, is God's peculiar prerogative; for causes best known to himself: And that it is not our business to have any hand or contrivance therein; nor to be busy bodies above our station, much less to plot and contrive the ruin, or overturn of any of them, but to pray for the king, and safety of our nation, and good of all men--That we may live a peaceable and quiet life, in all godliness and honesty; UNDER THE GOVERNMENT WHICH GOD IS PLEASED TO SET OVER US"--If these are REALLY your principles why do ye not abide by them?  Why do ye not leave that, which ye call God's Work, to be managed by himself?  These very principles instruct you to wait with patience and humility, for the event of all public measures, and to receive that event as the divine will towards you.  Wherefore, what occasion is there for your POLITICAL TESTIMONY if you fully believe what it contains?  And the very publishing it proves, that either, ye do not believe what ye profess, or have not virtue enough to practise what ye believe. The principles of Quakerism have a direct tendency to make a man the quiet and inoffensive subject of any, and every government WHICH IS SET OVER HIM.  And if the setting up and putting down of kings and governments is God's peculiar prerogative, he most certainly will not be robbed thereof by us: wherefore, the principle itself leads you to approve of every thing, which ever happened, or may happen to kings as being his work.  OLIVER CROMWELL thanks you.  CHARLES, then, died not by the hands of man; and should the present Proud Imitator of him, come to the same untimely end, the writers and publishers of the Testimony, are bound, by the doctrine it contains, to applaud the fact.  Kings are not taken away by miracles, neither are changes in governments brought about by any other means than such as are common and human; and such as we are now using.  Even the dispersion of the Jews, though foretold by our Saviour, was effected by arms.  Wherefore, as ye refuse to be the means on one side, ye ought not to be meddlers on the other; but to wait the issue in silence; and unless ye can produce divine authority, to prove, that the Almighty who hath created and placed this new world, at the greatest distance it could possibly stand, east and west, from every part of the old, doth, nevertheless, disapprove of its being independent of the corrupt and abandoned court of Britain, unless I say, ye can shew this, how can ye on the ground of your principles, justify the exciting and stirring up the people "firmly to unite in the abhorrence of all such writings, and measures, as evidence a desire and design to break off the happy connexion we have hitherto enjoyed, with the kingdom of Great-Britain, and our just and necessary subordination to the king, and those who are lawfully placed in authority under him." What a slap of the face is here! the men, who in the very paragraph before, have quietly and passively resigned up the ordering, altering,
and disposal of kings and governments, into the hands of God, are now, recalling their principles, and putting in for a share of the business. Is it possible, that the conclusion, which is here justly quoted, can any ways follow from the doctrine laid down?  The inconsistency is too glaring not to be seen; the absurdity too great not to be laughed at; and such as could only have been made by those, whose understandings were darkened by the narrow and crabby spirit of a despairing political party; for ye are not to be considered as the whole body of the Quakers but only as a factional and fractional part thereof. Here ends the examination of your testimony; (which I call upon no man to abhor, as ye have done, but only to read and judge of fairly;) to which I subjoin the following remark; "That the setting up and putting down of kings," most certainly mean, the making him a king, who is yet not so, and the making him no king who is already one.  And pray what hath this to do in the present case?  We neither mean to set up nor to pull down, neither to make nor to unmake, but to have nothing to do with them. Wherefore, your testimony in whatever light it is viewed serves only to dishonor your judgement, and for many other reasons had better have been let alone than published. First, Because it tends to the decrease and reproach of all religion whatever, and is of the utmost danger to society to make it a party in political disputes. Secondly, Because it exhibits a body of men, numbers of whom disavow the publishing political testimonies, as being concerned therein and approvers thereof. Thirdly, because it hath a tendency to undo that continental harmony and friendship which yourselves by your late liberal and charitable donations hath lent a hand to establish; and the preservation of which, is of the utmost consequence to us all. And here without anger or resentment I bid you farewell. Sincerely wishing, that as men and christians, ye may always fully and uninterruptedly enjoy every civil and religious right; and be, in your turn, the means of securing it to others; but that the example which ye have unwisely set, of mingling religion with politics, MAY BE DISAVOWED AND REPROBATED BY EVERY INHABITANT OF _AMERICA._ F I N I S.

STORY OF THE DOOR 
MR. UTTERSON the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance, that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary, and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. I incline to, Cains heresy, he used to say. I let my brother go to the devil in his quaintly: own way. In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of down-going men. And to such as these, so long as 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour. No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of goodnature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyers way. His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt, the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull, and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted.

It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the week-days. The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed, and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of their gains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger. Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east, the line was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point, a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It was two stories high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower story and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
5 of 118 
bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages. Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and pointed. Did you ever remark that door? he asked; and when his companion had replied in the affirmative, It is connected in my mind, added he, with a very odd story. Indeed? said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, and what was that? Well, it was this way, returned Mr. Enfield: I was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three o clock of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street, and all the folks asleep  street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church  till at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
6 of 118 
stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the, childs body and left her screaming on the ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasnt like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a view-halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had turned out were the girls own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been sent, put in his appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the Sawbones; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So had the childs family, which was only natural. But the doctors case was what struck me. He was the usual cutand-dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent, and about as emotional as a 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
7 of 118 
bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this, as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could, for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black, sneering coolness  frightened too, I could see that  but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan. If you choose to make capital out of this accident, said he, I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene, says he. Name your figure. Well, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the childs family; he would have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door?  whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
8 of 118 
matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Couttss, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I cant mention, though its one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for more than that, if it was only genuine. I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out of it with another mans cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and sneering. Set your mind at rest, says he, I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself. So we all set off, the doctor, and the childs father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the check myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine. Tut-tut, said Mr. Utterson. I see you feel as I do, said Mr. Enfield. Yes, its a bad story. For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties, 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your fellows who do what they call good. Black-mail, I suppose; an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black-Mail House is what I call that place with the door, in consequence. Though even that, you know, is far from explaining all, he added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing. From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: And you dont know if the drawer of the cheque lives there? A likely place, isnt it? returned Mr. Enfield. But I happen to have noticed his address; he lives in some square or other. And you never asked about the  place with the door? said Mr. Utterson. No, sir: I had a delicacy, was the reply. I feel very strongly about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment. You start a question, and its like starting a stone. You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of) is knocked on the head in his own backgarden and the family have to change their name. No, sir, 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I ask.  A very good rule, too, said the lawyer. But I have studied the place for myself, continued Mr. Enfield. It seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but theyre clean. And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must live there. And yet its not so sure; for the buildings are so packed together about that court, that its hard to say where one ends and another begins. The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then, Enfield, said Mr. Utterson, thats a good rule of yours. Yes, I think it is, returned Enfield. But for all that, continued the lawyer, theres one point I want to ask: I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child. Well, said Mr. Enfield, I cant see what harm it would do. It was a man of the name of Hyde. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
11 of 118 
Hm, said Mr. Utterson. What sort of a man is he to see? He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his appearance; something displeasing, something downright detestable. I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I couldnt specify the point. Hes an extraordinary-looking man, and yet I really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand of it; I cant describe him. And its not want of memory; for I declare I can see him this moment. Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration. You are sure he used a key? he inquired at last. My dear sir... began Enfield, surprised out of himself. Yes, I know, said Utterson; I know it must seem strange. The fact is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have been inexact in any point, you had better correct it. I think you might have warned me, returned the other, with a touch of sullenness. But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The fellow had a key;

12 of 118 
and whats more, he has it still. I saw him use it, not a week ago. Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man presently resumed. Here is another lesson to say nothing, said he. I am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to this again. With all my heart, said the lawyer. I shake hands on that, Richard.

SEARCH FOR MR. HYDE 
THAT evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on his reading-desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night, however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business-room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekylls Will, and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson, though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his friend and benefactor Edward Hyde, but that in case of Dr. Jekylls disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months, the said 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
14 of 118 
Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry Jekylls shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation, beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctors household. This document had long been the lawyers eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend. I thought it was madness, he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe, and now I begin to fear it is disgrace. With that he blew out his candle, put on a great-coat, and set forth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding patients. If any one knows, it will be Lanyon, he had thought.

The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up from his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at school and college, both thorough respecters of themselves and of each other, and, what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each others company. After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably pre-occupied his mind. I suppose, Lanyon, said he you and I must be the two oldest friends that Henry Jekyll has? I wish the friends were younger, chuckled Dr. Lanyon. But I suppose we are. And what of that? I see little of him now. Indeed? said Utterson. I thought you had a bond of common interest. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

We had, was the reply. But it is more than ten years since Henry Jekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind; and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old sakes sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the man. Such unscientific balderdash, added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, would have estranged Damon and Pythias. This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson. They have only differed on some point of science, he thought; and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of conveyancing), he even added: It is nothing worse than that! He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached the question he had come to put. Did you ever come across a protege of his  one Hyde? he asked. Hyde? repeated Lanyon. No. Never heard of him. Since my time. That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of little ease to his 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
17 of 118 
toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged by questions. Six o clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to Mr. Uttersons dwelling, and still he was digging at the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Mr. Enfields tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctors; and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams. Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
18 of 118 
still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every street-corner crush a child and leave her screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyers mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined. He might see a reason for his friends strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred. From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
19 of 118 
If he be Mr. Hyde, he had thought, I shall be Mr. Seek. And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken, by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten oclock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd, light footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court. The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
20 of 118 
manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and very plainly dressed, and the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against the watchers inclination. But he made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home. Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed. Mr. Hyde, I think? Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face, he answered coolly enough: That is my name. What do you want? I see you are going in, returned the lawyer. I am an old friend of Dr. Jekylls  Mr. Utter- son of Gaunt Street  you must have heard my name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me. You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home, replied Mr. Hyde, blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up, How did you know me? he asked. On your side, said Mr. Utterson, will you do me a favour? With pleasure, replied the other. What shall it be? 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
21 of 118 
Will you let me see your face? asked the lawyer. Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. Now I shall know you again, said Mr. Utterson. It may be useful. Yes, returned Mr. Hyde, it is as well we have, met; and a propos, you should have my address. And he gave a number of a street in Soho. Good God! thought Mr. Utterson, can he, too, have been thinking of the will? But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address. And now, said the other, how did you know me? By description, was the reply. Whose description? We have common friends, said Mr. Utterson. Common friends? echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. Who are they? Jekyll, for instance, said the lawyer. He never told you, cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. I did not think you would have lied. Come, said Mr. Utterson, that is not fitting language. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
22 of 118 
The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house. The lawyer stood a while when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of disquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a class that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing, and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. There must be some-thing else, said the perplexed gentleman. There is something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be the old story of Dr. Fell? or Is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
23 of 118 
Satans signature upon a face, it Is on that of your new friend. Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient, handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men: mapengravers, architects, shady lawyers, and the agents of obscure enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for the fan-light, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door. Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole? asked the lawyer. I will see, Mr. Utterson, said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall, paved with flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. Will you wait here by the fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining room? Here, thank you, said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy of his friend the doctors; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of it as the 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
24 of 118 
pleasantest room in London. But to-night there was a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out. I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting-room door, Poole, he said. Is that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home? Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir, replied the servant. Mr. Hyde has a key. Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man, Poole, resumed the other musingly. Yes, sir, he do indeed, said Poole. We have all orders to obey him. I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde? asked Utterson.  O, dear no, sir. He never dines here, replied the butler. Indeed we see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory. Well, good-night, Poole. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
25 of 118 
Good-night, Mr. Utterson. And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. Poor Harry Jekyll, he thought, my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, PEDE CLAUDO, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the fault. And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded a while on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, lest by chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many that he had come so near to doing, yet avoided. And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of hope. This Master Hyde, if he were studied, thought he, must have secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared to which poor Jekylls worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot continue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to Harrys bedside; poor 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
26 of 118 
Harry, what a wakening! And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the will, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulder to the wheel if Jekyll will but let me, he added, if Jekyll will only let me. For once more he saw before his minds eye, as clear as a transparency, the strange clauses of the will.

DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE 
A FORTNIGHT later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the lighthearted and the loose-tongued had already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in the mans rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire  a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness  you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson a sincere and warm affection.

I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll, began the latter. You know that will of yours? A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful; but the doctor carried it off gaily. My poor Utterson, said he, you are unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at what he called my scientific heresies. Oh, I know hes a good fellow  you neednt frown  an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant. I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon. You know I never approved of it, pursued Utterson, ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic. My will? Yes, certainly, I know that, said the doctor, a trifle sharply. You have told me so. Well, I tell you so again, continued the lawyer. I have been learning something of young Hyde. The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. I do not care to hear more, said he. This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop. What I heard was abominable, said Utterson.

It can make no change. You do not understand my position, returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. I am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange  a very strange one. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking. Jekyll, said Utterson, you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of it. My good Utterson, said the doctor, this is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isnt what you fancy; it is not so bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde. I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that Im sure youll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep. Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire. I have no doubt you are perfectly right, he said at last, getting to his feet. Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last time I hope, continued the doctor, there 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
30 of 118 
is one point I should like you to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I know you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But, I do sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if I am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise. I cant pretend that I shall ever like him, said the lawyer. I dont ask that, pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the others arm; I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake, when I am no longer here. Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. Well, said he, I promise.

THE CAREW MURDER CASE 
NEARLY a year later, in the month of October, 18  , London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone up-stairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maids window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became aware of an aged and beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come within speech (which was just under the maids eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
32 of 118 
of politeness. It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something high too, as of a wellfounded self-content. Presently her eye wandered to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr. Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a dislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling; but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
33 of 118 
It was two oclock when she came to herself and called for the police. The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter  the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and a gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson. This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of bed; and he had no sooner seen it, and been told the circumstances, than he shot out a solemn lip. I shall say nothing till I have seen the body, said he; this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait while I dress. And with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had been carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded. Yes, said he, I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir Danvers Carew. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
34 of 118 
Good God, sir, exclaimed the officer, is it possible? And the next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. This will make a deal of noise, he said. And perhaps you can help us to the man. And he briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken stick. Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself presented many years before to Henry Jekyll. Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature? he inquired. Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid calls him, said the officer. Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, If you will come with me in my cab, he said, I think I can take you to his house. It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a marvellous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
35 of 118 
here it would be dark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here, for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful re-invasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyers eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the laws officers, which may at times assail the most honest. As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating-house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings. This was the home 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
36 of 118 
of Henry Jekylls favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling. An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy; but her manners were excellent. Yes, she said, this was Mr. Hydes, but he was not at home; he had been in that night very late, but had gone away again in less than an hour; there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday. Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms, said the lawyer; and when the woman began to declare it was impossible, I had better tell you who this person is, he added. This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland Yard. A flash of odious joy appeared upon the womans face. Ah! said she, he is in trouble! What has he done? Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. He dont seem a very popular character, observed the latter. And now, my good woman, just let me and this gentleman have a look about us. In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these were furnished with 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
37 of 118 
luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the floor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had been burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt-end of a green cheque-book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other half of the stick was found behind the door. and as this clinched his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderers credit, completed his gratification. You may depend upon it, sir, he told Mr. Utterson: I have him in my hand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick or, above all, burned the cheque-book. Why, moneys life to the man. We have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the handbills. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had numbered few familiars  even the master of the servant-maid had only seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been photographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as common observers will. Only on one point, were they agreed; and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders.

INCIDENT OF THE LETTER 
IT was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr. Jekylls door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or the dissecting-rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friends quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the doctors cabinet. It was a large room, fitted round with glass 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
40 of 118 
presses, furnished, among other things, with a chevalglass and a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. A fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deadly sick. He did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice. And now, said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, you have heard the news? The doctor shuddered. They were crying it in the square, he said. I heard them in my dining-room. One word, said the lawyer. Carew was my client, but so are you, and I want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide this fellow? Utterson, I swear to God,  cried the doctor, I swear to God I will never set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done with him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of. The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friends feverish manner. You seem pretty sure of him, 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
41 of 118 
said he; and for your sake, I hope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear. I am quite sure of him, replied Jekyll; I have grounds for certainty that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you may advise me. I have  I have received a letter; and I am at a loss whether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in your hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so great a trust in you. You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection? asked the lawyer. No, said the other. I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this hateful business has rather exposed. Utterson ruminated a while; he was surprised at his friends selfishness, and yet relieved by it. Well, said he, at last, let me see the letter. The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed Edward Hyde": and it signified, briefly enough, that the writers benefactor, Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, As he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
42 of 118 
liked this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions. Have you the envelope? he asked. I burned it, replied Jekyll, before I thought what I was about. But it bore no postmark. The note was handed in. Shall I keep this and sleep upon it? asked Utterson. I wish you to judge for me entirely, was the reply. I have lost confidence in myself. Well, I shall consider, returned the lawyer. And now one word more: it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that disappearance? The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness: he shut his mouth tight and nodded. I knew it, said Utterson. He meant to murder you. You have had a fine escape. I have had what is far more to the purpose, returned the doctor solemnly: I have had a lesson  O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have had! And he covered his face for a moment with his hands. On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole. By the by, said he, there was a letter handed in to-day: what was the messenger like? But 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
43 of 118 
Poole was positive nothing had come except by post; and only circulars by that, he added. This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went, were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: Special edition. Shocking murder of an M. P. That was the funeral oration of one friend and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and selfreliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for advice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it might be fished for. Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest, his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds, the procession of the 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
44 of 118 
towns life was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the room was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago resolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, As the colour grows richer in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the doctors; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr. Hydes familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it not as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery to rights? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The clerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he would scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson might shape his future course. This is a sad business about Sir Danvers, he said. Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling, returned Guest. The man, of course, was mad. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
45 of 118 
I should like to hear your views on that, replied Utterson. I have a document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there it is; quite in your way a murderers autograph. Guests eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with passion. No, sir, he said: not mad; but it is an odd hand. And by all accounts a very odd writer, added the lawyer. Just then the servant entered with a note. Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir? inquired the clerk. I thought I knew the writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson? Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it? One moment. I thank you, sir"; and the clerk laid the two sheets of paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. Thank you, sir, he said at last, returning both; its a very interesting autograph. There was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself. Why did you compare them, Guest? he inquired suddenly. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
46 of 118 
Well, sir, returned the clerk, theres a rather singular resemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only differently sloped. Rather quaint, said Utterson. It is, as you say, rather quaint, returned Guest. I wouldnt speak of this note, you know, said the master. No, sir, said the clerk. I understand. But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night than he locked the note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. What! he thought. Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer! And his blood ran cold in his veins.

REMARKABLE INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON 
TIME ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable: tales came out of the mans cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of his vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a whisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of the murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on, Mr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to grow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde. Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and whilst he had always 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
48 of 118 
been, known for charities, he was now no less distinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air, he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was at peace. On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctors with a small party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against the lawyer. The doctor was confined to the house, Poole said, and saw no one. On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr. Lanyons. There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctors appearance. He had his deathwarrant written legibly upon his face. The rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly balder and older; and yet it was not so much, these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyers notice, 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
49 of 118 
as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. Yes, he thought; he is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted; and the knowledge is more than he can bear. And yet when Utterson remarked on his illlooks, it was with an air of greatness that Lanyon declared himself a doomed man. I have had a shock, he said, and I shall never recover. It is a question of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir, I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more glad to get away. Jekyll is ill, too, observed Utterson. Have you seen him? But Lanyons face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. I wish to see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll, he said in a loud, unsteady voice. I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead. Tut-tut, said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause, Cant I do anything? he inquired. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
50 of 118 
We are three very old friends, Lanyon; we shall not live to make others. Nothing can be done, returned Lanyon; ask himself. He will not see me, said the lawyer. I am not surprised at that, was the reply. Some day, Utterson, after I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I cannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me of other things, for Gods sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep clear of this accursed topic, then, in Gods name, go, for I cannot bear it. As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll, complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious in drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. I do not blame our old friend, Jekyll wrote, but I share his view that we must never meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is often shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
51 of 118 
sufferers also. I could not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this destiny, and that is to respect my silence. Utterson was amazed; the dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in view of Lanyons manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper ground. A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of his dead friend. PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE and in case of his predecease to be destroyed unread, so it was emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents. I have buried one friend to-day, he thought: what if this should cost me another? And then 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
52 of 118 
he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as not to be opened till the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll. Utterson could not trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketed. But in the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible. Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe. It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
53 of 118 
city, rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits.

INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW 
IT chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr. Enfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that when they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it. Well, said Enfield, that storys at an end at least. We shall never see more of Mr. Hyde. I hope not, said Utterson. Did I ever tell you that I once saw him, and shared your feeling of repulsion? It was impossible to do the one without the other, returned Enfield. And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that this was a back way to Dr. Jekylls! It was partly your own fault that I found it out, even when I did. So you found it out, did you? said Utterson. But if that be so, we may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if the presence of a friend might do him good. The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with sunset. The middle one of the three 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
55 of 118 
windows was half-way open; and sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll. What! Jekyll! he cried. I trust you are better. I am very low, Utterson, replied the doctor, drearily, very low. It will not last long, thank God. You stay too much indoors, said the lawyer. You should be out, whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my cousin  Mr. Enfield  Dr. Jekyll.) Come, now; get your hat and take a quick turn with us. You are very good, sighed the other. I should like to very much; but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask you and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit. Why then, said the lawyer, good-naturedly, the best thing we can do is to stay down here and speak with you from where we are. That is just what I was about to venture to propose, returned the doctor with a smite. But the words were hardly uttered, before the smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen

below. They saw it but for a glimpse, for the window was instantly thrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and left the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings of life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion. They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes. God forgive us, God forgive us, said Mr. Utterson. But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously and walked on once more in silence.

THE LAST NIGHT 
MR. UTTERSON was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole. Bless me, Poole, what brings you here? he cried; and then taking a second look at him, What ails you? he added; is the doctor ill? Mr. Utterson, said the man, there is something wrong. Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you, said the lawyer. Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want. You know the doctors ways, sir, replied Poole, and how he shuts himself up. Well, hes shut up again in the cabinet; and I dont like it, sir I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, Im afraid. Now, my good man, said the lawyer, be explicit. What are you afraid of? Ive been afraid for about a week, returned Poole, doggedly disregarding the question, and I can bear it no more. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
58 of 118 
The mans appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered for the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced his terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed to a corner of the floor. I can bear it no more, he repeated. Come, said the lawyer, I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is. I think theres been foul play, said Poole, hoarsely.  Foul play! cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather inclined to be irritated in consequence. What foul play? What does the man mean? I darent say, sir was the answer; but will you come along with me and see for yourself? Mr. Uttersons only answer was to rise and get his hat and great-coat; but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared upon the butlers face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was still untasted when he set it down to follow. It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and a flying wrack of the most diaphanous and 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
59 of 118 
lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square, when they got there, was all full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pockethandkerchief. But for all the hurry of his cowing, these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken. Well, sir, he said, here we are, and God grant there be nothing wrong. Amen, Poole, said the lawyer. Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, Is that you, Poole? 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
60 of 118 
Its all right, said Poole. Open the door. The hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was built high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of Mr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the cook, crying out, Bless God! its Mr. Utterson, ran forward as if to take him in her arms. What, what? Are you all here? said the lawyer peevishly. Very irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased. Theyre all afraid, said Poole. Blank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted up her voice and now wept loudly. Hold your tongue! Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and turned toward the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. And now, continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, reach me a candle, and well get this through hands at once. And then he begged Mr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back-garden. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
61 of 118 
Now, sir, said he, you come as gently as you can. I want you to hear, and I dont want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any chance he was to ask you in, dont go. Mr. Uttersons nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk that nearly threw him from his balance; but he re-collected his courage and followed the butler into the laboratory building and through the surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of the stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen; while he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door. Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you, he called; and even as he did so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear. A voice answered from within: Tell him I cannot see any one, it said complainingly. Thank you, sir, said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across the yard and into the great 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
62 of 118 
kitchen, where the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floor. Sir, he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, was that my masters voice? It seems much changed, replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look for look. Changed? Well, yes, I think so, said the butler. Have I been twenty years in this mans house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir; masters made away with; he was made, away with eight days ago, when we heard him cry out upon the name of God; and whos in there instead of him, and why it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr. Utterson! This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale, my man, said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. Suppose it were as you suppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been  well, murdered, what could induce the murderer to stay? That wont hold water; it doesnt commend itself to reason. Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but Ill do it yet, said Poole. All this last week (you must know) him, or it, or whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was sometimes 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
63 of 118 
his way  the masters, that is  to write his orders on a sheet of paper and throw it on the stair. Weve had nothing else this week back; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left there to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another paper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another order to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir, whatever for. Have you any of these papers? asked Mr. Utterson. Poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the lawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents ran thus: Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his present purpose. In the year 18  , Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large quantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with the most sedulous care, and should any of the same quality be left, to forward it to him at once. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can hardly be exaggerated. So far the letter 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
64 of 118 
had run composedly enough, but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writers emotion had broken loose. For Gods sake, he had added, find me some of the old. This is a strange note, said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, How do you come to have it open? The man at Maws was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like so much dirt, returned Poole. This is unquestionably the doctors hand, do you know? resumed the lawyer. I thought it looked like it, said the servant rather sulkily; and then, with another voice, But what matters hand-of-write?  he said. Ive seen him! Seen him? repeated Mr. Utterson. Well? Thats it! said Poole. It was this way. I came suddenly into the theatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this drug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was at the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when I came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped up-stairs into the cabinet. It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my head like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon his face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run from 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
65 of 118 
me? I have served him long enough. And then... The man paused and passed his hand over his face. These are all very strange circumstances, said Mr. Utterson, but I think I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seised with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer; hence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask and the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this drug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate recovery  God grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it is sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain and natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant alarms. Sir, said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, that thing was not my master, and theres the truth. My master here he looked round him and began to whisper  is a tall, fine build of a man, and this was more of a dwarf. Utterson attempted to protest. O, sir, cried Poole, do you think I do not know my master after twenty years? Do you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door, where I saw him every morning of my life? No, Sir, that thing in the mask was never Dr. Jekyll  God knows what it was, but it was 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
66 of 118 
never Dr. Jekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done. Poole, replied the lawyer, if you say that, it will become my duty to make certain. Much as I desire to spare your masters feelings, much as I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door. Ah Mr. Utterson, thats talking! cried the butler. And now comes the second question, resumed Utterson: Who Is going to do it? Why, you and me, was the undaunted reply. Thats very well said, returned the lawyer; and whatever comes of it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser. There is an axe in the theatre, continued Poole; and you might take the kitchen poker for yourself. The lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and balanced it. Do you know, Poole, he said, looking up, that you and I are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril? You may say so, sir, indeed, returned the butler. It is well, then, that we should be frank, said the other. We both think more than we have said; let us make 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
67 of 118 
a clean breast. This masked figure that you saw, did you recognise it? Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that I could hardly swear to that, was the answer. But if you mean, was it Mr. Hyde?  why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same bigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who else could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot, sir that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But thats not all. I dont know, Mr. Utterson, if ever you met this Mr. Hyde? Yes, said the lawyer, I once spoke with him. Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something queer about that gentleman  something that gave a man a turn  I dont know rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt it in your marrow kind of cold and thin. I own I felt something of what you describe, said Mr. Utterson. Quite so, sir, returned Poole. Well, when that masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it went down my spine like ice. Oh, I know its not evidence, Mr. Utterson. Im book-learned enough for that; but a man has 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
68 of 118 
his, feelings, and I give you my Bible-word it was Mr. Hyde! Ay, ay, said the lawyer. My fears incline to the same point. Evil, I fear, founded  evil was sure to come  of that connection. Ay, truly, I believe you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer (for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victims room. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw. The footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.  Pull yourself together, Bradshaw, said the lawyer. This suspense, I know, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make an end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the cabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the blame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any malefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round the corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the laboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations. As Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. And now, Poole, let us get to ours, he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the way into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now quite dark. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about their steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where they sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor. So it will walk all day, Sir, whispered Poole; ay, and the better part of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist, theres a bit of a break. Ah, its an ill conscience thats such an enemy to rest! Ah, sir, theres blood foully shed in every step of it! But hark again, a little closer  put your heart in your ears, Mr. Utterson, and tell me, is that the doctors foot? The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. Is there never anything else? he asked. Poole nodded. Once, he said. Once I heard it weeping! Weeping? how that? said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of horror. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
70 of 118 
Weeping like a woman or a lost soul, said the butler. I came away with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too. But now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest table to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in the quiet of the night. Jekyll, cried Utterson, with a loud voice, I demand to see you. He paused a moment, but there came no reply. I give you fair warning, our suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you, he resumed; if not by fair means, then by foul! if not of your consent, then by brute force! Utterson, said the voice, for Gods sake, have mercy! Ah, thats not Jekylls voice  its Hydes! cried Utterson. Down with the door, Poole! Poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and the red baise door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
71 of 118 
times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock burst in sunder and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet. The besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had succeeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet before their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and chattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer or two open, papers neatly set forth on the business-table, and nearer the fire, the things laid out for tea: the quietest room, you would have said, and, but for the glased presses full of chemicals, the most commonplace that night in London. Right in the midst there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and still twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and beheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large for him, clothes of the doctors bigness; the cords of his face still moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung upon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a self-destroyer. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
72 of 118 
We have come too late, he said sternly, whether to save or punish. Hyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the body of your master. The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre, which filled almost the whole ground story and was lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper story at one end and looked upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was Jekylls predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive. Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor.  He must be buried here, he said, hearkening to the sound. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
73 of 118 
Or he may have fled, said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door in the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they found the key, already stained with rust. This does not look like use, observed the lawyer. Use! echoed Poole. Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a man had stamped on it. Ay, continued Utterson, and the fractures, too, are rusty. The two men looked at each other with a scare. This is beyond me, Poole, said the lawyer. Let us go back to the cabinet. They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional awe-struck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented. That is the same drug that I was always bringing him, said Poole; and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over. This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn cosily up, and the teathings stood ready to the sitters elbow, the very sugar in the cup. There were 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
74 of 118 
several books on a shelf; one lay beside the tea-things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in his own hand, with startling blasphemies. Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came to the cheval glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in. This glass have seen some strange things, sir, whispered Poole. And surely none stranger than itself, echoed the lawyer in the same tones. For what did Jekyll  he caught himself up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness  what could Jekyll want with it? he said. You may say that! said Poole. Next they turned to the business-table. On the desk among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctors hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor. The 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
75 of 118 
first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance; but, in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement, read the name of Gabriel John Utterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet. My head goes round, he said. He has been all these days in possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document. He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctors hand and dated at the top. O Poole! the lawyer cried, he was alive and here this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space, he must be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how? and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? Oh, we must be careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire catastrophe. Why dont you read it, sir? asked Poole. Because I fear, replied the lawyer solemnly.  God grant I have no cause for it! And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read as follows: 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
76 of 118 
MY DEAR UTTERSON,  When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and first read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your hands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of Your unworthy and unhappy friend,  HENRY JEKYLL. There was a third enclosure? asked Utterson. Here, sir, said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet sealed in several places. The lawyer put it in his pocket. I would say nothing of this paper. If your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is now ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall be back before midnight, when we shall send for the police. They went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and Utterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the hall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained.

DR. LANYONS NARRATIVE 
ON the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague and old school-companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by this; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of registration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the letter ran: 10th December, 18  DEAR LANYON, You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day when, if you had said to me, Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason, depend upon you, I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you. Lanyon, my life, my honour my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface, that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge for yourself. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
78 of 118 
I want you to postpone all other engagements for tonight  ay, even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in your hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my butler, has his orders; you will find, him waiting your arrival with a locksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced: and you are to go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, with all its contents as they stand, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of wind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in error, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands. That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor fore-seen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
79 of 118 
then, I have to ask you to be alone in your consultingroom, to admit with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason. Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility. Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware that, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away like a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon,  and save  Your friend, H. J. P. S. I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my soul. It is possible that the postoffice may fail me, and this letter not come into your hands until to
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
80 of 118 
morrow morning. In that case, dear Lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the course of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It may then already be too late; and if that night passes without event, you will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll. Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to Jekylls house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denmans surgical theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekylls private cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near despair. But this last 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
81 of 118 
was a handy fellow, and after two hours work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish Square. Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so that it was plain they were of Jekylls private manufacture; and when I opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned my attention, might have been about half-full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version-book and contained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date, usually no more than a single word: double occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation, total failure!!! All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was definite. Here were a 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

phial of some tincture, a paper of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of Jekylls investigations) to no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life of my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why could he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral disease: and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence. Twelve oclock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico. Are you come from Dr. Jekyll? I asked. He told me yes by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the darkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing with his bulls eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor started and made greater haste.

These particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed him into the bright light of the consulting-room, I kept my hand ready on my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and  last but not least  with the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic, personal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred. This person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance, struck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable; his clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober fabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement  the trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

them from the ground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced me  something seizing, surprising, and revolting  this fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that to my interest in the mans nature and character, there was added a curiosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the world. These observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set down in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on fire with sombre excitement. Have you got it? he cried. Have you got it? And so lively was his impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake me. I put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my blood. Come, sir, said I. You forget that I have not yet the pleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please. And I showed him an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
85 of 118 
lateness of the hour, the nature of my pre-occupations, and the horror I had of my visitor, would suffer me to muster. I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon, he replied civilly enough. What you say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my politeness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry Jekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I under- stood... He paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his collected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteria  I understood, a drawer.. But here I took pity on my visitors suspense, and some perhaps on my own growing curiosity. There it is, sir, said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet. He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart: I could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life and reason. Compose yourself, said I. He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of despair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
86 of 118 
the contents, he uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, Have you a graduated glass? he asked. I rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he asked. He thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red tincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to brighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes of vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and the compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to a watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a keen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned and looked upon me with an air of scrutiny. And now, said he, to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you be guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go forth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it shall be done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you were before, and neither richer nor wiser,

unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you, here, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan. Sir, said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly possessing, you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I hear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end. It is well, replied my visitor. Lanyon, you remember your vows: what follows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your superiors  behold! He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I thought, a change  he seemed to swell  his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter  and the next 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
88 of 118 
moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arm raised to shield me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror. O God! I screamed, and O God! again and again; for there before my eyes  pale and shaken, and halffainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death  there stood Henry Jekyll! What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on paper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if I believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots; sleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the day and night; I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must die; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in memory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one thing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it) will be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house that night was, on Jekylls own confession, known by the name of Hyde and hunted for in every corner of the  land as the murderer of Carew. HASTIE LANYON.

HENRY JEKYLLS FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE 
I WAS born in the year 18  to a large fortune, endowed besides with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellow-men, and thus, as might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
90 of 118 
that made me what I was and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound mans dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies, which led wholly toward the mystic and the transcendental, re-acted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
91 of 118 
multifarious, incongruous, and independent denizens. I, for my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved day-dream, on the thought of the separation of these elements. If each, I told myself, could but be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust delivered from the aspirations might go his way, and remorse of his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these incongruous fagots were thus bound together that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
92 of 118 
continuously struggling. How, then, were they dissociated? I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side-light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling immateriality, the mist-like transience of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to shake and to pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on mans shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too evident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough, then, that I not only recognised my natural body for the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me because they were 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
93 of 118 
the expression, and bore the stamp, of lower elements in my soul. I hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled and shook the very fortress of identity, might by the least scruple of an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition, utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound, at last overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments, to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I compounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of courage, drank off the potion. The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
94 of 118 
very novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in body; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual images running like a mill-race in my fancy, a solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me like wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in stature. There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside me as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations. The night, however, was far gone into the morning  the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the conception of the day  the inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
95 of 118 
disclosed to them; I stole through the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde. I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but that which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature, to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in the course of my life, which had been, after all, ninetenths a life of effort, virtue, and control, it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter, and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto accustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
96 of 118 
observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil. I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the stature, and the face of Henry Jekyll. That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my discovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth an angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the prison-house of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that which stood within ran forth. 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
97 of 118 
At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence, although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse. Even at that time, I had not yet conquered my aversion to the dryness of a life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well known and highly considered, but growing toward the elderly man, this incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to assume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the notion; it seemed to me at the time to be humorous; and I made my preparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as housekeeper a creature whom I well knew to be silent and 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
98 of 118 
unscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr. Hyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my house in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made myself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that will to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I began to profit by the strange immunities of my position. Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did so for his pleasures. I was the first that could thus plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete. Think of it  I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my laboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done, Edward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
99 of 118 
midnight lamp in his study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry Jekyll. The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands of Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I would come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of my own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centred on self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse; he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And thus his conscience slumbered. Into the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I mean but to point out the 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
100 of 118 
warnings and the successive steps with which my chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and the childs family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate. Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about me; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed-curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I seemed to be, but in the 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
101 of 118 
little room in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and, in my psychological way began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size: it was large, firm, white, and comely. But the hand which I now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half shut on the bed-clothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of Edward Hyde. I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed, I rushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was changed into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained? I asked myself, and then, with another bound of terror  how was it to be remedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
102 of 118 
were up; all my drugs were in the cabinet  a long journey down two pairs of stairs, through the back passage, across the open court and through the anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It might indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that, when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my second self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting. Small indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed to me of late as though the body 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
103 of 118 
of Edward Hyde had grown in stature, as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown, the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward Hyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always equally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment. Now, however, and in the light of that mornings accident, I was led to remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly transferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to point to this: that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse. Between these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
104 of 118 
apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll, or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a fathers interest; Hyde had more than a sons indifference. To cast in my lot with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and for ever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it. Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to the liberty, the comparative 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
105 of 118 
youth, the light step, leaping impulses and secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward Hyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I was true to my determination; for two months I led a life of such severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and longings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught. I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I, long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which were the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I was punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was conscious, 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
106 of 118 
even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall. Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow; and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit; and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life screwed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on my crime,

light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger. Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to God. The veil of selfindulgence was rent from head to foot, I saw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood, when I had walked with my fathers hand, and through the selfdenying toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was solved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the better part of my existence; and oh, how I rejoiced to think it! with what willing humility, I embraced anew the restrictions of

natural life! with what sincere renunciation, I locked the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key under my heel! The next day, came the news that the murder had been overlooked, that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was a man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a tragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the scaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him. I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself how earnestly in the last months of last year, I laboured to relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the days passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say that I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead that I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my duality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to growl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
109 of 118 
Hyde; the bare idea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person, that I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was as an ordinary secret sinner, that I at last fell before the assaults of temptation. There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled at last; and this brief condescension to evil finally destroyed the balance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural, like a return to the old days before I had made discovery. It was a fine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted, but cloudless overhead; and the Regents Park was full of winter chirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench; the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a little, drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active goodwill with the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that vain-glorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then as in its turn the faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of

danger, a solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was corded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had been safe of all mens respect, wealthy, beloved  the cloth laying for me in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows. My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than once observed that, in my second character, my faculties seemed sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came about that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the importance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my cabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing my temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I had closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would consign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and thought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into his presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
111 of 118 
of his colleague, Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part remained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived that kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from end to end. Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face  happily for him  yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole;

and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city. He, I say  I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the lessfrequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled. When I came to myself at Lanyons, the horror of my old friend perhaps affected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
113 of 118 
which I looked back upon these hours. A change had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyons condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came home to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning shaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought of the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten the appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home, in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of hope. I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging and freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a double dose to recall me to myself; and alas! Six hours after, as I sat looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-administered. In short,

114 of 118 
from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this continuallyimpending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition (for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to contain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
115 of 118 
consciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh, where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll, was of a different order. His tenor of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks that he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would long ago have 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
116 of 118 
ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But his love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him. It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this description; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice; and yet even to these, habit brought  no, not alleviation  but a certain callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face and nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed since the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out for a fresh supply, and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and the first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was without efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London ransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply was impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the draught.

About a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under the influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last time, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts or see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I delay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has hitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in the act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and Circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from the action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing on us both, has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now, when I shall again and for ever re-indue that hated personality, I know how I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with the most strained and fear-struck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of menace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to release himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is my true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than myself. Here then, as I lay 
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  
118 of 118 
down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.
